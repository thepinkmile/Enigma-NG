# Enigma NG: Digital Cryptography Ecosystem

The Enigma-NG is an advanced "Museum-Grade", modular, and historically-accurate digital recreation of the world’s most iconic encryption machines.
Powered by a **Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5)**, this system controls a hardware stack of up to 30 custom CPLD-based rotors and a physical 64-jack plugboard.
Powered with either USB-C Power Adapter, PoE+ or Smart Battery. It bridges 1940s mechanical heritage with 2026 high-speed digital engineering.

## 🚀 Project Vision

To create a high-fidelity, educational, and industrially robust encryption platform.
The design prioritises classroom safety, professional EMI shielding, and deep hardware visibility for students via an integrated diagnostic bank.
Beyond a simple Enigma clone, this terminal is a **Universal Cipher Engine**. The hardware is designed to emulate:

* **Enigma Variants:** I, M3, M4, and Abwehr.
* **Typex:** The 5-rotor British adaptation with simulated printer output.
* **SIGABA:** The 15-rotor US system using complex 3-bank stepping algorithms.
* **NG-26** The modern digital enigma machine designed and created by Matthew McAtamney-Greenwood.

One of the long-term goals of this project is to introduce the ability to deliver Enigma encrypted data over the network,
and even provide the ability to deliver encrypted files using a base-64 encoding before executing the standard rotor-based encryption.
This end-goal will involve the definition of a new RFC for the "Enigma-Packet-Protocol (EnPP)", which will be a custom specification for this project's ecosystem.

## 🔌 Hardware Architecture

### 1. Power Module (The Heart)

* **Input:** Triple-input OR-ing between PoE+ 802.3bt Type 4, USB-C 15V PD, and Battery
  11–16.4V via LM74700-Q1 + CSD17483F4T ideal-diode FETs. PoE is explicitly prioritised over
  USB-C; USB-C vs Battery precedence follows the active input voltages unless extra gating is added.
* **PoE:** Fully discrete 802.3bt Type 4 front end — TPS2372-4 (PD interface) + TPS23730 (ACF DC-DC) + Coilcraft POE600F-12LD transformer stage. Implemented 12V power stage capacity: 60W.
* **Protection:** TPS25980 eFuse — 7A ILIM, 11.0V UVLO, 16.9V OVLO, 3mΩ RON. Plus 72°C TCO thermal fuse.
* **Buck:** Dual-phase interleaved LMQ61460-Q1 (×2, 6A each, 12A combined, 400kHz DRSS, 180° SYNC). Effective ripple: 800kHz.
* **LDO:** TPS75733KTTRG3 3V3_ENIG (8.8µVRMS noise, 72dB PSRR, 3A, 2.05 A typical load at 68.3% utilisation).
* **UPS:** LTC3350 supercap manager + 8× Abracon ADCR-T02R7SA256MB (2S4P, 50 F) on 5V_MAIN bus. 50 F at 5.4V → ≥33.5 second hold-up for clean CM5 shutdown.
* **Output Rails:** 5V_MAIN (12A) and 3V3_ENIG (3A — logic, CPLDs, and rotor stack) via 80-pin Samtec ERF8 BtB to Controller Board for distribution.
* **Panel Controls:** SW1 is a rugged latching RGB power toggle (Adafruit 4660) and SW2 is a
  matching 16mm momentary RGB CM5 power button (Adafruit 3350); both are panel-mounted controls
  wired to the Power Module harness.

### 2. Controller Board (The Brain)

* **Module:** Raspberry Pi CM5 (BCM2712) on a custom 6-layer 2oz carrier.
* **Power Input:** 3-way seamless switching (LM74700-Q1 ideal-diode on Power Module).
  * **Smart Battery:** 5-pin Molex Micro-Fit connector (11V-16.4V nominal) with SMBus telemetry + BATT_PRES_N.
  * **PoE+ (802.3bt Type 4):** Power-over-Ethernet delivered through the Power Module discrete
    TPS2372-4 + TPS23730 + POE600F-12LD path. The implemented 12V stage is sized at 60W. Single
    Ethernet cable carries both data and power.
  * **USB-C PD:** 15V USB-C PD negotiated input.
* **Protection:** Over-voltage and over-current protection provided by Power Module eFuse upstream; local reverse-polarity and ESD protection on BtB interface.
* **Rotor Rail:** The rotor stack is powered by the **3V3_ENIG** rail (TPS75733KTTRG3 LDO, 3A) generated on the Power Module; routed to rotor stack via Controller Board → Link-Beta. CM5 GPIO 16
  (ROTOR_EN) gates the LDO enable for sequenced power-up.
* **JTAG Master:** Embedded FT232H (Permanent USB Blaster) on internal USB 2.0.
* **Connectivity:** Native USB 3.0 (SMT), HDMI (SMT), and Gigabit Ethernet.

### 3. JTAG Daughterboard

* **Logic:** FT232H USB-to-JTAG bridge with buffered TCK / TMS drive.
* **Role:** Programs the full 37-device JTAG chain (1 Stator + 6 Encoder + 30 Rotor CPLDs).
* **Mounting:** Small internal hat-style daughterboard on the Controller; no external connectors.

### 4. Stator Board (Nervous System)

* **Role:** Removable vertical daughterboard and electrical backbone of the rotor stack.
* **Routing Hub:** Stator CPLD is the ENC_DATA routing matrix, reflector-map application point, and
  first device in the system JTAG chain.
* **Interconnects:** Hosts the Controller hybrid docks, rotor sockets, reflector / extension return
  connector, six Encoder-module IDC ports, and the Settings Board I2C harness.
* **Peripherals:** Owns the rotor-stack INA219 current monitor, three MCP23017 expanders, and the
  PCA9685 servo PWM driver.

### 5. Encoder Module (Universal Interface)

* **Generic PCB:** One single-sided board reused in six roles: `KBD_ENC`, `LBD_DEC`,
  `PLG_PASS1_DEC`, `PLG_PASS1_ENC`, `PLG_PASS2_DEC`, and `PLG_PASS2_ENC`.
* **Logic:** Intel **MAX II EPM240T100I5N** CPLD per board.
* **HID Path:** Physical keyboard layout is 40 positions (`[a-z0-9+=]` plus left / right Shift),
  while the logical repertoire remains the full 64-character code space.
* **Plugboard Path:** Two decode / encode board pairs provide the two configurable passive plugboard
  passes.

### 6. Settings Board (Configuration Panel)

* **Role:** User-accessible configuration board with 12 panel-mount toggles, 12 RGB LEDs, and a
  `CFG_APPLY` pushbutton.
* **Interface:** Shared Stator I2C-1 bus over a 6-wire harness (`3V3_ENIG`, `5V_MAIN`, `GND`, `SDA`,
  `SCL`, `GND`).
* **Expanders:** MCP23017 devices at `0x23`, `0x24`, and `0x25`.

### 7. Rotor Module (The Engine)

* **Logic:** Intel **MAX II EPM570T100I5N** CPLD.
* **Dimensions:** Ø92 mm PCB / **Ø100 mm shroud outer**.
* **Segments:** 64 characters with **8mm arc width** for high readability.
* **Memory:** 10 pre-loaded bidirectional wiring sets; 4-position DIP switch for "Rotor Identity" selection.
* **Sensing:** FDC2114RGHR capacitive encoder ICs (dual-track, 3+3 per rotor).
* **Tri-Connector Bus:**
  * Power (2x2), JTAG (2x4 Shielded), and Enigma (2x6 Bidirectional Relay) in a "Tripod" layout.
* **Signal Integrity:** **SN74LVC2G125DCUR** buffer on each Extension Board (one per 5-rotor group) for TCK/TMS regeneration.

### 8. Extension Board

* **Role:** Mid-stack bridge inserted between 5-rotor groups in extended builds.
* **JTAG Support:** Re-buffers `TCK` and `TMS` with `SN74LVC2G125DCUR` to restore timing margin for
  the downstream rotor group.
* **Power / Return Path:** Receives `3V3_ENIG` and `GND` through the Extension Port, passes
  `ENC_IN[0:5]`, `ENC_OUT[0:5]`, `SYS_RESET_N`, and `TTD_RETURN`, and avoids a parallel power path
  through the rotor BtB power connector.
* **Scale:** Up to five Extension Boards may be fitted in the full 30-rotor architecture.

### 9. Reflector Board

* **Role:** Passive end-of-stack turnaround board for the final rotor group.
* **Mapping Ownership:** No local CPLD; the Stator CPLD remains responsible for reflector-map
  selection and application.
* **JTAG Return:** Terminates the JTAG daisy-chain and returns `TTD_RETURN` to the Stator through the
  16-pin reflector ribbon.
* **Signal Path:** Returns the 6-bit ENC path back toward the Stator over a separate electrical path
  while keeping the board itself logically passive.

  application, and source-selection handoff between keyboard and CM5 virtual input.
* **Rotor CPLDs:** Implement the rotor wiring libraries and per-rotor identity selection.
* **Encoder CPLDs:** Provide the encode / decode logic used by the keyboard, lightboard, and both
  plugboard passes.

## ⚠️ Safety & Design Rules (KiCAD 9)

* **eFuse Latch-off:** Electronic fault protection requires manual power cycle to reset.
* **Soft Start:** SW1 drives the TPS25980 eFuse EN pin; the CM5 separately gates the 3V3_ENIG LDO with ROTOR_EN.
* **ESD Hardening:** TVS diodes on all exposed pins (JTAG, Enigma, and 64-jack lines).
* **Stackup:** Mixed stackup architecture: Controller Board and Power Module are 6-layer boards; the remaining electronics boards are 4-layer / 2oz designs.

## 📅 Development Roadmap

1. **Battery connector review:** confirm whether alternative battery-connector options should replace
   or supplement the present Power Module choice.
2. **Encoder board updates:** finish the current Encoder review / update pass and confirm whether any
   structural split work is still required.
3. **Extension follow-up:** review mechanical usage and whether notch-rotation pass-through needs extra
   circuitry.
4. **Coupon / PAS planning:** add and review board-level coupons and acceptance-test hooks across the
   design set.
5. **Deep review rerun:** rerun the review passes after the next material design-document change set.
