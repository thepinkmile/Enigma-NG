## 2. Core Logic

* **Role:** Converts the CM5's USB 2.0 signals into standard JTAG signalling (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO) commands.
* **Bridge IC:** [FT232H datasheet](design/Datasheets/FT232H-datasheet.md) - High-Speed USB 2.0 to MPSSE.
* **Function:** Dedicated JTAG programmer for the global chain (30x Rotor CPLDs + 6x Encoder CPLDs + 1x Stator CPLD).
* **Configuration:** 12MHz crystal-controlled for stable JTAG programming via the CM5. See DEC-022.
* **Software Stack:** `ftdi_sio` kernel module for USB enumeration; `OpenOCD` with `libftdi` for JTAG/MPSSE
  operation (no custom driver required). CM5 enumerates the FT232H on Linux boot via `ftdi_sio`.

## 3. Interface & Wiring

### J1 — DF40C-20 Board-to-Board Connector (20-Pin, 0.4mm Pitch)

* **Type:** Hirose DF40C-20DP-0.4V(51) — 20-pin 0.4mm pitch BtB plug
* **Purpose:** Single board-to-board interface providing system power (5V_USB + 3V3_ENIG from CTL),
  USB 2.0 data path to CM5 (D+/D-), and JTAG output signals (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO) — all in one connector.
* **Physical location:** Bottom-centre of board; R1 on outer (bottom) edge; faces toward CTL LINK-BETA connector (J4/J5) when mounted.
* **Mating Part (Controller J12):** Hirose DF40HC(3.5)-20DS-0.4V(51) — 3.5mm stack height BtB receptacle. See `Controller/Design_Spec.md §8.3`.
* **Stack height:** 3.5mm (matching AM dock — same standoffs, 9774035151R, held in CTL BOM MH9–MH12).
* **Polarity enforcement:** The DF40 connector body is polarity-free (Note 4 in Hirose datasheet);
  asymmetric placement of MH1–MH4 mounting holes (per DR-JM-18) is mandatory to enforce a single
  valid mating orientation. A silkscreen pin-1 marker is required on both boards (per
  `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §7.1`).

### FT232H JTAG Signal Mapping (MPSSE Mode)

* AD0 → **TCK** (Clock)
* AD1 → **TDI** (Data In)
* AD2 → **TDO** (Data Out)
* AD3 → **TMS** (State Machine)

### Voltage

3.3V logic level (VCCIO = 3V3_ENIG). FT232H VCC = 5V_USB. 5V-tolerant I/O.

### GND_CHASSIS Single-Point Bond

Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5`, the JM is exempt from the local
`GND_CHASSIS` requirement because it is a board-mounted daughterboard that does **not** connect
directly to the enclosure. Its mounting holes / conductive standoffs therefore tie to **GND**
only, not to a standalone `GND_CHASSIS` net. The system's only galvanic GND ↔ GND_CHASSIS bond
remains on the Power Module at the common power-entry point immediately before the eFuse.

## 4. Aesthetics & Mounting

* **Visibility:** Completely hidden internally.
* **Mounting:** Small **4-layer** PCB (DEC-017) mounted as a hat on the Controller Board via conductive
  standoffs. As a non-chassis-connected daughterboard, its mounting holes tie to **GND** only.
  The M2.5 standoffs used to attach the JM to the CTL are specified and sourced in the
  **Controller Board BOM** (MH9–MH12, 9774035151R). See `design/Electronics/Controller/Design_Spec.md`,
  DEC-057 (standoff ownership rule), and DEC-058 for the JM upgrade decision.
  Mounting hole positions (MH1–MH4) are defined relative to the JM board edge; final CTL board
  locations are deferred to PCB layout. See `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §4` for module
  mounting hole specification rules.
* **Data Plate:** Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §6` on Layer L4, Revision Block text: `PROGRAMMIERWERK [JTAG Module] V1.0`.

## 5. PCB Fabrication & Stackup

Inverted 4-layer stackup per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §2.3.2`.
Physical properties: see `design/Production/JLCPCB_Manufacturing.md §1.1`. For JTAG CI trace width compliance, see `Board_Layout.md §6.1`.

## 6. Electrical Requirements

* **Power Architecture:**
  * FT232H VCC = **5V_USB** (5V) via J1 DF40 Pin C4R1 - from the Controller Board's TPS2065C-protected
    USB power rail (same current-limited rail as the USB 3.0 ports, 1.6A limit).
  * FT232H VCCIO = **3V3_ENIG** (3.3V) via J1 DF40 Pin C7R1 - sets JTAG signal voltage to match
    CPLD I/O logic levels (same role as CM5 GPIO reference voltage).
  * FT232H VBUS pin tied to **5V_USB** (always-on; USB connection to CM5 is internal - no VBUS monitoring needed).
  * USB connection is **entirely internal**: D+ and D- travel from FT232H via J1 DF40 connector (C5R2/C6R2)
    through the Controller Board PCB directly to the CM5 USB 2.0 port. No USB-C connector on the JM.
  * FT232H operates in **self-powered USB mode** - power from system (5V_USB), not from USB host.
  * CM5 enumerates the FT232H when Linux boots and ftdi_sio loads; no JM-side power sequencing required.
  * Controller TPS2065C is the upstream current limiter; no additional current limiter on JM.
* **Bulk Capacitor Exception:** The JM is exempt from the standard 5x bulk entry bank rule. The Controller
  Board upstream provides a fully-bypassed power rail. Per-IC decoupling per FT232H datasheet: C1-C4, C6-C9
  = 8x 100nF (one per FT232H supply pin: VCCA, VCORE, VCCD, VCCIOx3, VPLL, VPHY) plus a single 4.7µF
  entry filter (C5) on 5V_USB.
* **UART/MPSSE Mode-Switch Contention (Informational):** The FT232H supports both UART and MPSSE modes.
  During mode-switch transitions (e.g., when `ftdi_sio` loads before OpenOCD re-opens the device in MPSSE
  mode), TX/RX lines briefly enter an undefined state. On the JM, FT232H UART lines (AD4/AD5) are not
  externally connected to the JTAG chain, so this does not affect normal operation. If future firmware
  exercises FT232H UART capability, the mode-switch sequence in FTDI Application Note AN_135 must be
  followed to prevent false characters or bus glitches.
* **FT232H REF Pin Biasing (DR-JM-21):** R8 (12 kΩ ±1%, ERJ-2RKF1202X) connected from FT232H REF (pin 5) to GND.
  The REF pin sets the USB 2.0 High-Speed PHY internal bias reference current. A precise 12 kΩ ±1% resistor
  is required per FTDI FT232H datasheet §3.5 and Application Note AN_146. Without R8, the HS PHY cannot
  negotiate chirp and the device falls back to USB Full-Speed (12 Mbps) or fails to enumerate entirely.
* **FT232H TEST Pin (DR-JM-22):** FT232H TEST (pin 42) is tied directly to GND by a PCB copper trace.
  No series component is placed. Per FTDI FT232H datasheet Table 3.2: TEST is a factory test pin that
  must be connected to GND for normal operation. Leaving TEST floating enables internal factory test mode
  and corrupts USB enumeration behaviour., ensuring the chip
  remains deasserted (RESET_N HIGH = normal operation) at all times during normal use. RESET_N is active-low;
  if left floating the pin may latch LOW and prevent the FT232H from operating. An external pull-up is
  required per FTDI application note AN_108 when RESET_N is not driven by the host (see DR-JM-16).
  `RESET_N` is a board-local net name scoped to JM; it does not conflict with the system-level
  `CPLD_RESET_N` net, which is driven by the Stator CPLD and distributed across inter-board connectors.
  Separate KiCAD projects are used per board, so these net names remain naturally isolated at capture time.
* **Clocking:** Dedicated 12MHz SMD crystal (Y1) for the FT232H reference clock. The FT232H internal PLL requires 12MHz; CM5 GPCLK
  option was considered and rejected - see DEC-022. Note: package corrected from SMD-3225 to SMD-5032 per CTS 435 datasheet. KiCAD footprint adapted from the unofficial
  Crystal_SMD_5032-4Pin symbol in KiCAD 10.0; 3D model approximated from the 2-pin 5032 STEP. Crystal load capacitors C10-C11 (33pF C0G) set the 20pF crystal load capacitance.
  **Load cap calculation:** The crystal specifies C_L = 20pF. Two equal load caps in series give C_series = C/2; adding PCB stray
  capacitance (C_stray ≈ 3-4pF, from PCB traces and FT232H XTIN input capacitance) yields:
  C_L = C/2 + C_stray = 33/2 + 3.5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.5 = **20pF ✔**
  33pF C0G is therefore the correct value. Do not change to 15pF (which would give C_L ≈ 7.5 + 3.5 = 11pF, far below spec).
* **JTAG Signal Integrity:**
  * **R1 (33Ω):** Series termination on FT232H TDI output, placed within 2mm of the FT232H TDI pin.
    TDI drives only the first CPLD in the chain (single load) - source termination at the FT232H pin
    provides matched drive (FT232H output ≈ 20Ω + R1 33Ω ≈ 53Ω) for the board-to-board path.
    Per DEC-016 intra-board/BtB termination rule. See `design/Electronics/JTAG_Module/JTAG_Integrity.md`.
  * **R4 (33Ω):** Series damping on TDI signal (not buffered) before J1 (TDI pin, C10R1). Combined with R1 at FT232H, provides damping at both ends of the FT232H-to-J1 TDI path.
  * **U2 (SN74LVC2G125DCUR, VSSOP-8):** Dual-channel 3-state buffer placed between the FT232H and
    J1 connector (JTAG OUTPUT side), buffering TCK and TMS for the 37-device JTAG chain load. TDI is not
    buffered - FT232H TDI drives only the first device in the chain directly. 1OE and 2OE (active-low
    output enables) are permanently tied to GND, keeping both buffer channels always enabled.
  * **R2 (33Ω):** Series damping on U2 TCK output, placed within 2mm of the U2 output pin, before
    J1 DF40 connector (TCK pin, C1R1). Source impedance after U2: U2_out (≈15Ω) + R2 (33Ω) ≈ 48Ω - matched
    to 50Ω BtB trace impedance per DEC-024.
  * **R3 (33Ω):** Series damping on U2 TMS output - same function as R2 (TCK). Placed before J1 (TMS pin, C2R2).
  * **Pull Resistors:** TMS 10kΩ pull-up (R6) and TCK 10kΩ pull-down (R7) near J1 connector to hold JTAG TAP in defined state
    when idle (see §5 and JTAG best-practice note in `design/Electronics/JTAG_Module/JTAG_Integrity.md`).
  * **Trace Width Rule:** All JTAG signal traces on L2 (signal layer) shall be routed at the CI width specified in
    `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §2.3.2` (inner stripline), targeting **50 Ω controlled impedance**.

> **Signal Integrity note (JM as complete JTAG master):** The JM hosts all JTAG buffering and
> termination for the system. U2 buffers TCK and TMS for the 37-device chain load. Series damping
> (R2-R4) at 33 Ω matches the BtB trace impedance (50 Ω) per DEC-016. The Controller `J12` ↔ Stator
> `J10` logic dock is a direct board-to-board connection (no cable) - 33 Ω applies throughout (not
> the 75 Ω cable-driving rule).
> The Controller board routes JTAG lines as pass-through without active components. See DEC-024.
>
## 7. Thermal & ESD

* **Thermal:** Low-power debug board; no thermal management required.
* **ESD:** No TVS/ESD protection required — J1 (DF40C-20 BtB connector) is an internal board-to-board connector with no user access, per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §9`.
