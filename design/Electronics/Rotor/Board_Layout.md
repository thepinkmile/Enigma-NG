## 1. Split Board Architecture Overview

Each rotor assembly consists of two circular PCBs (Board A and Board B), each Ø92mm, separated
by an 11.8mm gap and connected by eight single-row 2.54mm THT headers (J7–J14, 44 pins total; mixed gender for keying):
Board A carries J7 (1×5), J8 (1×5), J11 (1×5), J14 (1×7); Board B carries J9 (1×5), J10 (1×7), J12 (1×5), J13 (1×5).
The two boards are mechanically
retained inside the aluminium shroud (Ø100mm outer face, 4mm radial wall, Ø92mm inner). Total
rotor thickness is ~15mm.

## 2. Board A - Input Side (Ø92mm)

Board A faces the input (upstream) side of the rotor stack.

## 5. Rotor Interface Connectors
>
> **Connector Definition Owner:** This board. All other boards hosting rotor interface connectors
> (Stator J1-J3, Extension J1-J6, Reflector J1-J3) cross-reference here.

Each rotor position uses **three connectors** - one for ENC data in, one for ENC data out, and one for power/JTAG.
These three connectors must be **positionally identical** across every board that mates with rotors
(Stator input side, Extension mid-stack, Reflector final output) to allow any rotor to mate at any position.

> **⚠️ Note:** The earlier draft signal maps (ENC-IN, ENC-OUT, PWR/JTAG with 8-pin and 14-pin tables)
> have been removed. All connector definitions now live exclusively in `Rotor/Design_Spec.md §3.4`.
> Use the Design_Spec §3.4 tables for all schematic and PCB layout work.
>
### 5.1 Connector Summary

Each rotor carries **six connectors** - three male ERM8 headers on the input side (J1-J3) and three female
ERF8 sockets on the output side (J4-J6). See `Rotor/Design_Spec.md §3.4` for the authoritative pinout tables.

| Designator | Type | Part | Pins | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| J1 | ERM8-005 male | 200-ERM8005050SDVKTR | 10 (2x5) | JTAG input |
| J2 | ERM8-005 male | 200-ERM8005050SDVKTR | 10 (2x5) | Power input |
| J3 | ERM8-010 male | 200-ERM8010050SDVKTR | 20 (2x10) | Encoder data input + ACTUATE_REQUEST_IN_N/OUT_N (pins 13/14, per DEC-093) |
| J4 | ERF8-005 female | 200-ERF8005050SDVKTR | 10 (2x5) | JTAG output → next rotor J1 |
| J5 | ERF8-005 female | 200-ERF8005050SDVKTR | 10 (2x5) | Power output → next rotor J2 |
| J6 | ERF8-010 female | 200-ERF8010050SDVKTR | 20 (2x10) | Encoder data output → next rotor J3, plus ACTUATE_REQUEST_OUT_N/IN_N (pins 13/14, per DEC-093) |

### 5.2 TTD Routing Note

TTD (JTAG Transmission Data) does not chain back through the Extension Port individually per rotor. Each
rotor passes TTD to the **next rotor's TDI** directly via J4 pin 6 → next Rotor J1 pin 6. Only **Rotor 30**
(last in chain) routes its TDO via the Reflector back to Stator J10 pin 16 as TTD_RETURN.

---

## 6. U1 - Rotor CPLD Signal Map (Logical Pin Budget)

> This is the board-authoritative **logical** signal map for Rotor Board A `U1`. The local MAX II
> handbook confirms `EPM570T100` package availability in TQFP-100, but it points printed device
> pin-outs to external package documentation rather than providing a fixed package pin table locally.
> The map below therefore freezes the required rotor connectivity while leaving exact TQFP pad numbers
> to schematic capture.

### 6.1 Dedicated device pins

| Function | Source / destination | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TCK` | J1 pin 2 / J8 pin 1 -> U1 | Dedicated JTAG clock input; forwarded to Board B and onwards to J4 |
| `TMS` | J1 pin 4 / J8 pin 3 -> U1 | Dedicated JTAG mode input; forwarded to Board B and onwards to J4 |
| `TDI` | J1 pin 6 (`TTD`) -> U1 | Incoming serial JTAG data from the previous stage; connector name stays `TTD` for stack clarity |
| `TDO` | U1 -> J8 pin 5 / J4 pin 6 (`TTD`) | Outgoing serial JTAG data to the next stage |
| `DEV_CLR_N` / reset input | J1 pin 8 (`CPLD_RESET_N`) / J8 pin 4 -> U1 | Active-low device reset; held high locally by R4 (vendor name `DEV_CLRN` renamed `DEV_CLR_N` per GRS active-low naming convention) |

### 6.2 General-purpose signal groups

| Signal group | Pins | U1 direction | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `J3 ENC_IN[5:0]` | 6 | Input | Forward-path cipher input from the upstream stage |
| `J6 ENC_OUT[5:0]` | 6 | Output | Forward-path cipher result to the downstream stage |
| `J6 ENC_IN[5:0]` | 6 | Input | Return-path cipher input from the downstream stage |
| `J3 ENC_OUT[5:0]` | 6 | Output | Return-path cipher result back to the upstream stage |
| `J3 ACTUATE_REQUEST_IN_N` | 1 | Input | Actuation-trigger forward pass, received from the upstream stage (per DEC-093) |
| `J3 ACTUATE_REQUEST_OUT_N` | 1 | Output | Actuation-trigger return pass, driven back to the upstream stage (per DEC-093) |
| `J6 ACTUATE_REQUEST_OUT_N` | 1 | Output | Actuation-trigger forward pass, driven to the downstream stage (per DEC-093) |
| `J6 ACTUATE_REQUEST_IN_N` | 1 | Input | Actuation-trigger return pass, received from the downstream stage (per DEC-093) |
| `SW1[5:0]` | 6 | Input | Ring-setting switch bank on Board A |
| `SW2[5:0]` | 6 | Input | Forward-map select switch bank on Board A |
| `SW3[5:0]` | 6 | Input | Return-map select switch bank brought from Board B via `J14` |
| Local `SDA`, `SCL` | 2 | Bidirectional | CPLD I2C master for U2/U11A/U11B position sensors; `J11` extends the same bus to Board B U11B |

**Logical budget summary:** 48 general-purpose signal connections total = **32 inputs + 14 outputs + 2
bidirectional I2C lines**, plus the dedicated JTAG / reset pins above.

**Variant / reserve policy:** `ENC[5]` remains physically routed for the shared 20-pin connector pinout
even on N=26 builds where that bit is logically unused. `J11` pins 3-5 stay reserved and are not
currently tied into U1. Virtual JTAG position export uses the dedicated JTAG infrastructure and does
not consume extra board-level I/O pins. The 4 `ACTUATE_REQUEST_*` signals (per DEC-093) use spare
CPLD I/O headroom; exact synthesis-time propagation logic (how a given Rotor's CPLD routes `IN`
to `OUT` across the forward and return passes) is firmware-configurable and TBD in a future
design pass.

## 7. Routing - Trace Width Specifications

**Board specs:** 4-layer / 2oz finished copper — stackup per GRS §2.3.1.
L1 = signal (JTAG/routing); L2 = GND plane; L3 = 3V3_ENIG power pour; L4 = secondary routing / data plate.

**IPC-2221A basis (2oz copper, external, 10°C rise, 25°C ambient):**
For 2oz external: ~0.15 mm/A. The 3V3_ENIG inner pour (L3) handles bus current without width constraints.
See Global_Routing_Spec.md §1.1 for the full current-category table.

**Rotor power analysis (pass-through sizing):**
Each rotor draws 50 mA (EPM570) + 2 x 2.1 mA (FDC2114 pair U2/U11B or U2/U11A) = **54.2 mA ≈ 55 mA** locally.
The J2 power input connector daisy-chains 3V3_ENIG through J5 to the next rotor within the same
mini-stack. Each mini-stack contains a maximum of **5 rotors**; 3V3_ENIG is re-injected fresh at
each mini-stack boundary by an Extension Board (via its J5, fed from the Extension Port J7).
All rotor PCBs are **identical**, so traces must be sized for the worst case - **Rotor 1** of any
mini-stack, which receives power for all 5 rotors in its group.
Using the 55 mA design budget, Rotor 1 carries **275 mA** through its J2 connector and passes
4 x 55 mA = **220 mA** to Rotor 2 via J5.

| Rotor position in mini-stack | J2 input current | Local draw | J5 output current |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rotor 1 (worst case) | 275 mA | 55 mA | 220 mA |
| Rotor 3 (mid-stack) | 165 mA | 55 mA | 110 mA |
| Rotor 5 (last in mini-stack) | 55 mA | 55 mA | 0 A |

IPC calculation for worst-case 275 mA at 2oz external: 0.275 x 0.15 mm = 0.04 mm → **0.80 mm**
(3V3_ENIG canonical width per Global_Routing_Spec §1.1; consistent with PM, Stator, and Extension
Board 3V3_ENIG trunk traces).

### 7.1 Trace Width Table

| Net | Peak Current | IPC Calc (2oz ext) | Design Min | **Specified Width** | Layer | Notes |

| JTAG signals: TCK, TMS, TTD in/out (CI) | signal | - | per GRS §2.3.1 | **per GRS §2.3.1 / JLCPCB_Manufacturing.md §1.1** | L1 (external) | 50 Ω controlled impedance over L2 GND plane; per DEC-016. External layer - no inner-layer minimum conflict. |
| 3V3_ENIG local draw (J2 → CPLD + FDC2114 supply) | 55 mA | 0.008 mm | per GRS §1.1 | **per GRS §1.1** | L1 + L3 pour | 3V3_ENIG canonical width per GRS §1.1; local IC supply only |
| 3V3_ENIG pass-through rail (J2 input → J5 output bus) | 275 mA (Rotor 1 of mini-stack; 5 rotors max) | 0.04 mm | per GRS §1.1 | **per GRS §1.1** | L1 + L3 pour | Canonical 3V3_ENIG trunk width per GRS §1.1; Rotor 1 worst case for a 5-rotor mini-stack; feeds L3 pour via thermal vias between J2 and J5 |
| 3V3_ENIG distribution (inner power pour) | up to 275 mA | - | pour | **copper pour** | L3 | Full uninterrupted 2oz plane; primary distribution across the board |
| GND return (inner GND pour) | - | - | pour | **copper pour** | L2 | Reference plane; must be solid and uninterrupted under all CI traces on L1 |

### 7.2 Notes

* **JTAG CI traces:** 50 Ω controlled impedance on L1 over the L2 GND plane. Trace width per GRS §2.3.1 and `design/Production/JLCPCB_Manufacturing.md §1.1`.
* **No series termination on BtB stack path.** 75 Ω series termination applies to the Stator ribbon
  cable ports only (see `Stator/Board_Layout.md §8`). Rotor-to-rotor BtB connectors (J4/J5) are
  unterminated; no series termination resistor is used on this board. (Per DEC-077: omission of the
  DEC-016-mandated 33 Ω per-stub resistor at J2/J5 TTD junctions is intentional — stacking
  30 × 33 Ω would accumulate 990 Ω and degrade JTAG signal integrity across the full rotor stack.)
* **3V3_ENIG power rail:** The L3 copper pour is the primary current path. L1 surface traces per
  GRS §1.1 connect J2/J5 connector pads to the L3 pour via thermal vias. All rotor boards share
  the same PCB layout - the canonical width per GRS §1.1 provides substantial margin above the 275 mA
  mini-stack worst case (IPC minimum: 0.04 mm). 3V3_ENIG is re-injected at each mini-stack boundary
  by an Extension Board, so no rotor ever passes more than 5 x 55 mA = 275 mA through J2.

## 8. PCB Keep-Out Zones

### 8.1 Central Shaft Keep-Out

A central NPTH (non-plated through-hole) of Ø10mm nominal (8-12mm TBD) is required at the board
centre of **both** Board A and Board B to accommodate the rotor support shaft.

| Zone | Radius from centre | Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Shaft hole | 0-5mm | NPTH - no copper barrel, no plating |
| Keep-out (clearance) | 5-6mm | No copper, pads, vias, or silkscreen |
| Routing may begin | r > 6mm | Components and traces permitted outside this boundary |

**Rationale:** The shaft is a metal rod and must remain electrically isolated from all PCB nets.
The NPTH construction with copper keep-out ensures no galvanic continuity between shaft and
board. The L2 GND plane and L3 3V3\_ENIG pour must both be voided around this zone on all layers.

> **Cross-reference:** `design/Mechanical/Rotor/Design_Spec.md §7` for full shaft support
> rationale, mechanical tolerance, and electrical isolation requirements.

## 9. Mounting Holes

Per DR-ROT-08, each rotor assembly uses 4x M3 mounting holes (2 per board). The hole positions
define the 4 corners of the inscribed square of the Ø92mm circular PCB, making it straightforward
to design a rectangular mechanical enclosure around the rotor stack.

### 9.1 Inscribed Square Reference

For a circular PCB of diameter Ø92mm (radius 45mm):

* Inscribed square side length: 92 / √2 ≈ 65.1mm
* Corner distance from board centre: ≈ 32.5mm along each axis

| Corner | X (from centre) | Y (from centre) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Top-left | −32.5 mm | +32.5 mm |
| Top-right | +32.5 mm | +32.5 mm |
| Bottom-right | +32.5 mm | −32.5 mm |
| Bottom-left | −32.5 mm | −32.5 mm |

> **Note:** Exact coordinates are subject to final confirmation at PCB Layout. The 8mm shaft hole
> at the board centre (§8.1) and the keep-out zone (r < 6mm) must be confirmed first. Rotor PCBs
> rotate within the mechanical enclosure so the inscribed-square hole positions ensure all 4 corners
> of any surrounding rectangular structure have a mounting point.

### 9.2 Board A — Mounting Holes

Board A carries 2 of the 4 inscribed-square corner holes:

| Hole | Position (from centre) | Specification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MH1A | Top-left (−32.5, +32.5) approx. | Ø3.2mm PTH; ENIG annular ring; net: `GND_CHASSIS` |
| MH2A | Bottom-right (+32.5, −32.5) approx. | Ø3.2mm PTH; ENIG annular ring; net: `GND_CHASSIS` |

### 9.3 Board B — Mounting Holes

Board B carries the remaining 2 inscribed-square corner holes:

| Hole | Position (from centre) | Specification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MH1B | Top-right (+32.5, +32.5) approx. | Ø3.2mm PTH; ENIG annular ring; net: `GND_CHASSIS` |
| MH2B | Bottom-left (−32.5, −32.5) approx. | Ø3.2mm PTH; ENIG annular ring; net: `GND_CHASSIS` |

### 9.4 GND_CHASSIS Bond

Per GRS §4 (Mechanical Grounding) and F-103: all 4 mounting hole copper ring pads (MH1A, MH2A,
MH1B, MH2B) are tied to the `GND_CHASSIS` net. This provides Faraday-cage continuity from the
rotor assembly to the chassis through the metal support rod and enclosure structure.

> **Note:** The 8mm support rod (DR-ROT-08) passes through the shaft hole at the board centre
> (§8.1), not through these corner mounting holes. The corner holes are for static mechanical
> attachment to the enclosure frame; the central rod provides dynamic alignment and connector
> stress relief for the rotating stack.

### 9.5 BOM

No BOM entry required for these mounting holes — they are plain PCB holes with ENIG annular
rings.
