# Rotor Board (V1.0) Design Specification

**Status:** Draft
**Project:** Enigma-NG
**Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot
**Version:** v.0.1.0
**Associated Hardware Revision:** Rev A
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-26

## 1. Overview

The Enigma-NG uses a 30-rotor stack. Unlike the original mechanical rotors, these are **Smart Digital Rotors**
where the internal scrambled wiring is emulated by a dedicated logic chip on each module.

Each rotor assembly consists of **two circular PCBs** (Board A and Board B), each **Ø92mm**,
inside an aluminium shroud (Ø100mm outer face, 4mm radial wall). The two boards are separated
by an ~11.8mm gap and connected by four single-row 2.54mm THT headers (J7 1×5, J8 1×5,
J9 1×5, J10 1×7; 22 pins total; mixed gender for physical keying) on
their inner (facing) surfaces. Total rotor thickness is ~15mm, matching original Enigma rotor
proportions. These internal headers are manually assembled post-JLCPCB SMT pick-and-place.

**Board A (input side):** Carries the CPLD (U1), FDC2114 U2 (Track A encoder), SW1 (ring
setting), SW2 (forward map select), and J1–J3 (ERM8 male, input connectors).

**Board B (output side):** Carries FDC2114 U4 (Track B encoder, N=64 only), SW3 (return map
select), and J4–J6 (ERF8 female, output connectors).

The aluminium shroud is retained by **rolling-pin style cylindrical bearings** around the
circumference with **ceramic or nylon rolling elements** (electrically isolating). The shroud
must remain **electrically floating** — not connected to circuit ground. Gray code position
slots are milled into the inner faces of the shroud flanges (dish side for Track A, Board A;
cover side for Track B, Board B). Bare copper electrode pads on the PCB flat face at r≈44mm
sense the pattern capacitively. Characters are engraved on the outer cylindrical face of the
shroud at r=50mm.

The current position of the outer ring is detected using a **dual-track absolute capacitive
encoder** (N=64) or **single-track STGC encoder** (N=26). For N=64, 3+3 sensor electrodes on
Board A and Board B read a 6-bit standard reflected Gray code with zero multi-bit transitions.
For N=26, all 5 STGC electrodes are on Board A only (U4 on Board B is not populated).

Two rotor variants are defined: the **26-character variant** (5-bit STGC, compatible with
original Enigma rotors I–VIII, Beta, Gamma) and the **64-character variant** (6-bit dual-track
Gray code, supporting the extended Enigma-NG character set). Both variants use identical PCB
footprints, connector pinouts, and DIP switch mechanisms for full interoperability within a
mixed stack. Variant-specific details are in
`design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_26_Char_Design.md` and
`design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_64_Char_Design.md`.

For mechanical dimensions, tolerances, shroud specification, and encoder slot geometry, see
`design/Mechanical/Rotor/Design_Spec.md`.

### GND_CHASSIS Single-Point Bond

Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5`, each rotor PCB implements a local
`GND_CHASSIS` net tied to its M2.5 alignment holes and any stationary mechanical chassis-contact
features, but it does **not** implement a local GND-to-GND_CHASSIS bond. The system's only
galvanic GND ↔ GND_CHASSIS bond remains on the Power Module at the common power-entry point
immediately before the eFuse. The rotating aluminium shroud remains electrically floating and must
not be used as a local chassis-bond point.

## 2. Core Design

### 2.1 Position Sensing (Dual-Track Capacitive Encoder)

The rotor outer ring position is detected contactlessly using a **dual-track absolute capacitive
encoder** (N=64) or **single-track STGC encoder** (N=26). All active components reside on the
rotor PCBs; the rotating aluminium shroud requires only milled slot patterns on its inner
flanges — no conductive ink, no magnets, and no mechanical contacts.

#### Physical Arrangement

* **PCB diameter:** 92 mm (45 mm radius).
* **Sensor electrodes:** Bare copper electrode pads on the PCB flat face (inner face of each
  board, facing the shroud flanges). No SMT components are placed on the electrode pads.
* **Electrode radius:** r ≈ 44 mm from board centre on both Board A and Board B.
* **Shroud slots:** Gray code patterns are milled as slots/pockets into the inner faces of the
  aluminium shroud flanges. Solid aluminium over an electrode = high capacitance (logic 1 from
  FDC2114); milled slot over an electrode = low capacitance (logic 0).
* **Gap:** 0.5mm ±0.15mm (0.35mm min – 0.65mm max) between PCB electrode and shroud flange inner face (controlled by bearing
  precision).
* **Shroud isolation:** The shroud must remain electrically **floating** (not connected to
  circuit ground). Rolling-pin cylindrical bearings with ceramic or nylon rolling elements
  provide the required electrical isolation.

#### Sensing ICs

Each rotor variant populates **two Texas Instruments FDC2114RGHR** (4-channel
capacitive-to-digital converter, I²C, 3.3 V, 16-VQFN), but the second device differs by variant:

* **U2 (Board A)** — senses Track A (bits[5:3] for N=64; STGC bits[3:0] for N=26); I²C address 0x2A.
  Track A slots milled into the inner face of the shroud **dish** flange (Board A side).
* **U3 (Board A, N=26 only)** — second FDC2114 for the N=26 variant, addr 0x2B. CH0 = STGC bit[4]; CH1–CH3 unused
  (each carries a dummy LC tank — same 18 µH + 33 pF **in parallel** between INxA/INxB — per TI app note;
  GND-tie causes oscillation instability). **U3 is not populated for N=64**. N=26 variant: U2
  (addr 0x2A) reads STGC bits[3:0], U3 (addr 0x2B, Board A) reads STGC bit[4].
* **U4 (Board B, N=64 only)** — senses Track B (bits[2:0] for N=64 only); I²C address 0x2B.
  Track B slots milled into the inner face of the shroud **cover** flange (Board B side).
  **U4 is not populated for N=26 rotors.** Unused channels carry a dummy LC tank (18 µH + 33 pF
  **in parallel** between INxA/INxB) per TI app note; GND-tie causes oscillation instability.

The CPLD implements a simple I²C master and polls U2 and U3 (N=26) or U2 and U4 (N=64) at power-up and after
each detected position change. Each channel reports HIGH (solid aluminium) or LOW (milled slot).

The local FDC2114 bus requires one external pull-up on `SDA` and one on `SCL` to `3V3_ENIG`; these
are captured in the Board A BOM so the same pull-up pair serves the common local bus in both variants
(`U2` + `U3` on Board A for N=26, or `U2` on Board A plus `U4` over `J11` for N=64). Per the
in-repo TI FDC2114 family datasheet power-supply recommendation, each populated FDC2114 also carries
its own local `0.1 µF` + `1 µF` `VDD` bypass pair. These support parts are separate from the resonant
front-end and unused-channel support components, which are fully specified in §2.1 (Resonant Front-End Topology).

#### CPLD Position Decode

**N=64 (dual-track, 6-bit reflected Gray code):**
The 6 sensor readings (G[5:3] from U2 Track A, G[2:0] from U4 Track B) form a 6-bit standard
reflected Gray code. The CPLD decodes via XOR chain:

```text
B5 = G5 ; B4 = B5 XOR G4 ; B3 = B4 XOR G3
B2 = B3 XOR G2 ; B1 = B2 XOR G1 ; B0 = B1 XOR G0
```

No lookup table required. All 64 codes are valid. Zero multi-bit transitions at any position
including the 63→0 wrap. Full decode detail in `Rotor_64_Char_Design.md §7`.

**N=26 (single-track, 5-bit STGC):**
The 5 sensor readings (U2 STGC bits[3:0] and U3 STGC bit[4], both on Board A) form a 5-bit STGC code. A **combinational
lookup table** in the CPLD VHDL maps each valid code to its corresponding binary position
(0 to 25). Invalid codes flag a between-character fault. Standard Gray code is not achievable
for N=26 (not a power of 2); the lookup table is retained. Full decode detail in
`Rotor_26_Char_Design.md §7`.

The decoded binary position feeds directly into the SW1 modulo-N adder (§2.3).

Variant-specific track bit patterns and full decode tables are defined in:

* `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_26_Char_Design.md` §7
* `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_64_Char_Design.md` §7

#### Resonant Front-End Topology

Each active FDC2114 channel drives a resonant LC tank to detect the aluminium shroud segment. The
tank consists of an **18 µH unshielded SMD inductor (Bourns CWF1610A-180K)** and a **33 pF C0G/NP0 ±1% capacitor** connected
**in parallel** between the channel's INxA and INxB pins (single-ended mode; `CHx_FIN_SEL = 0b10`).
Nominal resonant frequency: **~6.5 MHz**.

* **Clock source:** CLKIN tied to GND — FDC2114 uses its internal oscillator (~43.35 MHz). No
  external crystal required.
* **IDRIVE baseline:** `0b01111` (register `DRIVE_CURRENT_CHx` = 0x7C00). Lab validation required;
  see `design/Procedures/Lab_Tests.md` **LT-001**.
* **Deglitch setting:** `0b101` = 10 MHz (register `MUX_CONFIG` deglitch field = 0x0005). Lab
  validation required; see `design/Procedures/Lab_Tests.md` **LT-002**.
* **Unused channels:** Each unused channel carries a **dummy LC tank** (same 18 µH + 33 pF in
  parallel between INxA/INxB). Tying unused INx pins directly to GND causes oscillation
  instability in active channels per TI application note; the dummy load is required.
* **FDC2114 firmware:** None. The FDC2114 has no user-programmable firmware. All register
  configuration is performed at runtime by the CPLD I²C master (VHDL bitstream). JTAG programs
  the CPLD only. Full I²C register table in `design/Software/CPLD_Logic/Rotor_Logic.md`.

### 2.2 Logic & Transposition

* **Logic:** The **Intel MAX II EPM570T100I5N CPLD** performs real-time cipher substitution for
  both the forward and return signal paths simultaneously.
* **Role:** Applies the active cipher map to incoming ENC\_IN data and outputs the substituted
  value as ENC\_OUT. The forward-pass and return-pass maps are selected independently by SW2 and
  SW3 respectively:
  * **Forward path:** J3 ENC\_IN[0:W-1] → CPLD applies SW2-selected map → J6 ENC\_OUT[0:W-1]
  * **Return path:** J6 ENC\_IN[0:W-1] → CPLD applies SW3-selected map → J3 ENC\_OUT[0:W-1]
  * W = 5 for 26-character variant; W = 6 for 64-character variant.
    Note: N denotes alphabet size (26 or 64) throughout this document; W denotes ENC bus active bit width.
* **Memory:** The CPLD UFM stores 21 forward-direction cipher maps in the common 64-entry × 6-bit format (384 bits per map, 21 maps × 384 = 8,064 bits, within the 8,192-bit UFM).
  Both rotor variants use this identical map count and selection mechanism; the actual map data
  is variant-specific. The EPM570T100I5N is required (570 LEs): a 64-character map needs
  384 flip-flops for the loaded register table plus ~80 LEs for combinational decode, totalling
  ~464 LEs — exceeding the EPM240's 240 LEs. Same TQFP-100 footprint; drop-in at PCB level.
* **Map selection (SW2 / SW3):** Each 6-position DIP switch encodes:
  * Bits [4:0] — map index, selecting one of the 21 stored forward maps (indices 0–20 valid;
    21–31 reserved).
  * Bit [5] — direction: `0` = apply map forward (map[input] = output);
    `1` = apply map in reverse (find input such that map[input] = output, i.e. inverse lookup).
  * This direction bit effectively doubles the usable configurations to **42 per side** without
    requiring additional UFM storage.
  * SW2 and SW3 are independent — in normal Enigma operation they are set to a matched
    forward/inverse pair (same index, opposite directions), but the hardware does not enforce this.
* **Latency:** At power-up the CPLD serially reads the selected map(s) from UFM into internal
  flip-flop registers (~40 µs per 384-bit map at the 10 MHz UFM clock — well under 1 ms total,
  invisible to the user). At runtime, cipher substitution is applied combinationally from the
  loaded registers; typical latency is **~20–50 ns per rotor hop**. The full 30-rotor round-trip
  completes in ~1.2–3 µs — far below any practical timing constraint.
* **Configuration:** SW2 and SW3 are read at power-up only. A power cycle is required after
  changing either switch. The CPLD is programmed once via JTAG; map selection at runtime uses
  SW2/SW3 exclusively. See `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_26_Char_Design.md` and
  `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_64_Char_Design.md` for map data definitions and character-set
  details.
* Decoupling and bulk entry capacitor requirements per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3`.

### 2.3 Mechanical Details

* **Mounting:** Each rotor PCB has two **M2.5 alignment holes**.
* **Stack Orientation:** The rotor stack is oriented **horizontally** (matching original Enigma
  machine aesthetics). In this orientation, rotor weight does not bear on the ERM8/ERF8 connector
  engagement faces.
* **Support Rod:** An **8mm solid metal support rod (non-threaded)** passes through the centre of
  all 30 rotors. The rod provides mechanical alignment and relieves stress on the ERM8/ERF8
  connectors during assembly and handling. It is not a retention mechanism; individual rotors
  remain removable by sliding them off the rod.
* **Hot-Swappable:** The Samtec ERM8 Edge-Rate connectors are rated for high mating cycles,
  allowing individual rotors to be pulled for reconfiguration without tools.
* **Connector Configuration:** Each rotor carries **3 separate ERM8 connectors** (JTAG, Power,
  ENC\_DATA) mating into matching ERF8 female sockets on the next rotor (or Stator for Rotor 1,
  Reflector for Rotor 30). Physical separation of connector types provides keying — it is
  mechanically impossible to mismate a power connector into a JTAG socket.

#### Ring Setting DIP Switches (SW1 — Input Side Only)

Each rotor carries a **6-position DIP switch (SW1)** on the input face that sets the ring
setting (Ringstellung), emulating the ring and notch position of an original Enigma rotor.

* **Location:** Input side only. SW1 is not present on or accessible from the output face.
* **Function:** The CPLD continuously sums SW1[5:0] with the decoded capacitive encoder position
  reading, modulo N (N = 26 for 26-char variant; N = 64 for 64-char variant), to produce the
  **effective position**. When this matches the notch trigger value for the active map, the CPLD
  signals the next rotor in the stack to advance one position (turnover).
* **Cross-reference:** See `design/Mechanical/Rotor/Design_Spec.md` for the
  ring gear, notch wheel, and mechanical turnover engagement mechanism.

#### Map Selection DIP Switches (SW2 / SW3)

A **6-position DIP switch** is mounted on each face of the rotor PCB for cipher map selection:

* **SW2 (input face):** Selects the map and direction for the **forward-pass** (J3 → J6).
* **SW3 (output face):** Selects the map and direction for the **return-pass** (J6 → J3).
  Completely independent of SW2.
* **Bit encoding (both SW2 and SW3):**
  * Bits [4:0] — map index: selects one of the 21 UFM forward maps (indices 0–20 valid).
  * Bit [5] — direction: `0` = forward; `1` = reverse (CPLD computes inverse lookup on the fly).
* **Effective configurations:** 21 maps × 2 directions = **42 per side**.
* **Normal operation:** SW2 and SW3 are set to the same map index with opposite directions
  (one forward, one reverse), emulating the linked forward/return wiring of an original Enigma
  rotor. The hardware does not enforce this — non-matching maps are valid.
* Both rotor variants use the **identical** SW2/SW3 footprint and encoding.

## 3. Electrical Requirements

### 3.1 Power Management

* **Input:** 3.3V/**~54.2mA typical per rotor** (design budget: **55mA/rotor**) sourced from the
  **Power Module** `3V3_ENIG` rail, routed through Controller Board → Stator Board → Rotor stack via
  the active Stator logic dock.
  See `design/Electronics/Power_Budgets.md` for full budget — 30 rotors draw **1.63A typical / 1.65A budget**; the 150mA/rotor figure previously used was a conservative overestimate.
* **Filtering:** Local **10uF X7R** bulk entry bank on each rotor; upstream rail filtering uses the **Stator ferrite bead bank** to suppress stack switching noise.
* Decoupling and bulk entry capacitor requirements per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3`.

### 3.2 Communication Bus

* **The ENC Data Path:** The cipher bus passes through every rotor in the stack (Stator → Rotor 1
  → … → Rotor 30 → Reflector forward; reverse for the return path). At **each rotor the CPLD
  applies the active cipher substitution** — data is NOT passed through transparently:
  * **Forward path:** J3 ENC\_IN[0:W-1] → CPLD applies SW2-selected map (direction per SW2[5])
    → J6 ENC\_OUT[0:W-1]
  * **Return path:** J6 ENC\_IN[0:W-1] → CPLD applies SW3-selected map (direction per SW3[5])
    → J3 ENC\_OUT[0:W-1]
  * W = 5 for 26-character variant; W = 6 for 64-character variant (N denotes alphabet size; W denotes ENC bus active bit width).
  * All connectors carry 6 bits (ENC[5:0]) regardless of variant to maintain a common pinout
    across mixed stacks. The 26-character variant leaves ENC[5] as NC.
  * This path is entirely separate from the JTAG TTD\_RETURN signal.
* **JTAG TTD\_RETURN Path:** After the Reflector processes the cipher reversal, `TTD_RETURN` travels
  separately: Reflector J4 → Stator J10 → Controller-facing `J5` logic dock → FT232H on JDB (JTAG
  chain closure only).
* **Control:** Each rotor has a local I²C bus for position sensing (FDC2114 U2/U4 for N=64; U2/U3 for N=26). The CPLD acts as I²C master; no I²C signals are exposed on J1–J6.
* **JTAG:** Pass-through lines allow the **USB Blaster** on the Controller Board to program the
  entire 30-rotor stack in one daisy-chain operation. Under normal operation JTAG is idle; cipher
  maps are selected via SW2/SW3 without reprogramming.

### 3.3 Signal Integrity

* **Impedance:** 50Ω single-ended traces for JTAG and data lines to prevent reflections.
* **Layer Stack (4-Layer DEC-017):**
  * **L1:** Signal (JTAG routing + data traces). JTAG traces run on L1 over L2 GND plane.
  * **L2:** GND plane (solid, contiguous) — provides reference for L1 controlled-impedance traces.
  * **L3:** 3V3_ENIG power plane — provides local decoupling reference.
  * **L4:** Signal (secondary routing + data plate silkscreen on bottom).
* **JTAG Trace Width Rule:** All JTAG signal traces on L1 shall be routed at **0.127 mm (5 mil)**
  width over the L2 GND plane, targeting **50 Ω controlled impedance** per the JLC04161H-7628
  stackup (h=0.087mm, t=0.035mm, Eᵣ=4.4). See `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md §3.1`
  for the copper-weight note (2oz finished uses 1oz base copper t=0.035mm in the IPC-2141A formula) and DEC-016.
* **TTD path policy:** The rotor-stack `TTD` path is a direct board-to-board chain. No series resistor is
  placed at each rotor hop; `TTD` exits the CPLD and continues straight to J4 pin 6. Cable-driving
  damping is reserved for the ribbon-port interfaces on the Stator / Encoder boards, while the
  Reflector retains the single 22 Ω end-of-chain damping resistor on `TTD_RETURN`.
* **Pull Resistors (R2–R5, 10kΩ, per CPLD):**
  * **TMS (R2):** 10kΩ pull-up to 3V3_ENIG — ensures JTAG TAP resets to Test-Logic-Reset on power-up.
  * **TDI (R3):** 10kΩ pull-up to 3V3_ENIG — holds TDI at logic-1 (BYPASS) when not actively driven.
  * **TCK (R4):** 10kΩ pull-down to GND — prevents spurious clocking when TCK is floating.
  * **SYS\_RESET\_N (R5):** 10kΩ pull-up to 3V3_ENIG — active-low; pull-up holds CPLD out of reset by default.
  These are present on every rotor board. With 30 rotors, 30 sets of pull resistors exist in the full stack;
  this is intentional and consistent with making each rotor independently safe in any stack position.
* **Shielding:** 4-layer PCB with solid GND plane (L2) to isolate digital switching from the high-accuracy capacitive encoder.

### 3.4 Connector Pinouts (Rotor Interface — Authority Document)
>
> This section is the **authoritative pinout definition** for all Rotor-to-Stator connectors.
> All other boards (Stator) cross-reference this section. See DEC-018 for ownership rationale.
>
#### J1 — JTAG Interface (ERM8-005, 10-pin 2×5, 0.8mm pitch)

| Pin | Row A | Pin | Row B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | GND | 2 | TCK |
| 3 | GND | 4 | TMS |
| 5 | GND | 6 | TTD |
| 7 | GND | 8 | SYS\_RESET\_N |
| 9 | GND | 10 | spare/GND |

> **TTD Net Name:** The JTAG serial chain data pin is designated **TTD** (JTAG Transmission Data) at pin 6
> on both input and output connectors. On J1 (input side), TTD carries incoming TDI; on J4 (output side),
> TTD carries outgoing TDO to the next rotor's TDI. This unified net name avoids the TDI/TDO direction
> confusion when viewing connector pinouts in isolation. Consistent with the T-prefix JTAG signal naming
> convention (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO → TTD).
>
#### J2 — Power Interface (ERM8-005, 10-pin 2×5, 0.8mm pitch)

> 12 signal pins + 8 GND fill pins. All spare pins assigned as GND for improved EMI shielding
> and signal return paths around the encoder data bus. Both ENC_IN and ENC_OUT on J3 are active simultaneously:
> ENC_IN receives forward-pass data from upstream; ENC_OUT carries the CPLD SW3-map return-pass result back upstream.
> The 26-character variant uses ENC[0:4] only; ENC[5] = NC on those boards.
>
#### J4 — JTAG Interface Output (ERF8-005, 10-pin 2×5, 0.8mm pitch, FEMALE socket)

Mates with the next rotor's J1 (ERM8-005 male header) or Reflector J1.

| Pin | Row A | Pin | Row B |

| 9 | GND | 10 | spare/GND |

> Pin 6 = TTD (CPLD TDO output — feeds next stage's J1 pin 6 TTD input). Pin 10 = spare/GND (no TTD_RETURN path here; return travels via Reflector → Extension Port → Stator J10).
>
#### J5 — Power Interface Output (ERF8-005, 10-pin 2×5, 0.8mm pitch, FEMALE socket)

Mates with the next rotor's J2 (ERM8-005 male header) or Reflector J2.

> ENC_OUT carries the CPLD SW2-map forward-pass substitution result downstream; ENC_IN receives return-pass data from downstream for SW3-map processing.
> Both directions are applied by the CPLD — this is NOT a pass-through. The 26-character variant uses ENC[0:4] only; ENC[5] = NC on those boards.
>
#### J_INT — Board A ↔ Board B Internal Interconnect (8× single-row 2.54mm THT headers, 44 pins total)

Fitted on the **inner (facing) surface** of both Board A and Board B. Physical keying is achieved
by **mixed gender** — Board A carries J11 and J14 as male (PH1-UA) and J7 and J8 as
female (RS1-G); Board B carries the inverse, with J12 and J13 as male (PH1-UA) and J9 and
J10 as female (RS1-G). The unique 7-pin footprint of J10/J14 makes incorrect board orientation
geometrically impossible. All 8 headers are **manually soldered/assembled AFTER JLCPCB SMT
pick-and-place** and are NOT part of the JLCPCB SMT order.

Placement: equally spaced around the inner face at a radius halfway between the outer Samtec
connectors and the PCB edge, to maximise mechanical rigidity of the two-board assembly.

> **Assembly note:** Eight connectors per rotor assembly (4 per board × 2 boards = 8; 30 rotors
> × 8 = 240 total connectors across the full stack; 120 on Board A, 120 on Board B).
>
##### J10/J14 — Return Map Select (1×7, 7-pin)

Board B (J10): **RS1-07-G** (female) · Board A (J14): **PH1-07-UA** (male)

| 5 | SW3[4] | B→A | Map select bit 4 (Board B SW3 → Board A CPLD) |
| 6 | SW3[5] | B→A | Map direction bit (Board B SW3 → Board A CPLD) |
| 7 | GND | — | Ground reference |

> **SW3 bit coverage note:** All 6 SW3 DIP switch bits reach the CPLD on Board A via J14:
> pins 1–4 carry SW3[3:0]; pins 5–6 carry SW3[4:5].
>
##### J7/J12 — Power Distribution (1×5, 5-pin)

Board A (J7): **RS1-05-G** (female) · Board B (J12): **PH1-05-UA** (male)

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 3V3_ENIG | A→B | Power |
| 2 | 3V3_ENIG | A→B | Power |
| 3 | 3V3_ENIG | A→B | Power |
| 4 | 3V3_ENIG | A→B | Power |
| 5 | GND | — | Ground |

##### J8/J13 — JTAG Pass-Through (1×5, 5-pin)

Board A (J8): **RS1-05-G** (female) · Board B (J13): **PH1-05-UA** (male)

Compact internal transfer of the four JTAG/reset nets plus one shared ground between Board A and Board B.

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | TCK | A→B | JTAG clock |
| 2 | GND | — | Shared signal return |
| 3 | TMS | A→B | JTAG mode select |
| 4 | SYS_RESET_N | A→B | Active-low reset forwarded to Board B and onward to J4 pin 8 |
| 5 | TTD | A→B | JTAG serial data (Board A J1 pin 6 input → Board B J4 pin 6 output path) |

##### J9/J11 — Board B Sensor Interface (1×5, 5-pin)

Board B (J9): **RS1-05-G** (female) · Board A (J11): **PH1-05-UA** (male)

Carries the local I²C link used by the Board A CPLD to poll FDC2114 U4 on Board B. U4 measurement
results return over I²C; no dedicated POS_B parallel readback wires are required. The remaining pins
are reserved so the same 1×5 keyed header footprint can be retained across both rotor variants.

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | SDA | A→B | I²C data (CPLD master → U4 FDC2114 on Board B) |
| 2 | SCL | A→B | I²C clock (CPLD master → U4 FDC2114 on Board B) |
| 3 | GND | — | Ground return for I²C bus |
| 4 | GND | — | Ground return |
| 5 | GND | — | Ground return |

> **Variant note:** N=64 builds populate U4 on Board B and use SDA/SCL plus the GND return pins.
> N=26 builds do not populate U4; SDA/SCL and GND pins remain wired but unused in both variants.

## 6. Thermal & ESD

### 6.1. ESD Protection — Samtec ERM8/ERF8 Connectors

The Samtec ERM8/ERF8 rotor connectors (`J1`–`J3` on Board A, `J4`–`J6` on Board B) are external,
hot-swappable interfaces per **DEC-045** (see `design/Design_Log.md`). All signal lines entering or
leaving the board via these connectors must be ESD-protected with TVS arrays placed close to the
connector body, before any series resistors or downstream logic (see `Global_Routing_Spec.md §9`).

**Connectors requiring ESD protection:**

| Connector | Board | Interface | Signal Lines Requiring TVS |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| J1 | A | JTAG input (ERM8-005 male) | `TDI`, `TMS`, `TCK` — 3 lines |
| J3 | A | Encoder data input (ERM8-010 male) | `ENC_IN[5:0]`, `ENC_OUT[5:0]` — 12 lines |
| J4 | B | JTAG output (ERF8-005 female) | `TDO`, `TMS`, `TCK` — 3 lines |
| J6 | B | Encoder data output (ERF8-010 female) | `ENC_IN[5:0]`, `ENC_OUT[5:0]` — 12 lines |

> Power rail connectors `J2` (Board A) and `J5` (Board B) do not require dedicated TVS devices;
> board-level bulk decoupling capacitors (C9–C13) provide adequate `3V3_ENIG` rail protection.

**ESD device requirements:**

* Working voltage: ≥ 3.3 V (signal lines operate on `3V3_ENIG` only — no `5V_MAIN` on Rotor)
* Clamping voltage: ≤ 6.0 V at rated peak current
* IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4 capability (±8 kV contact, ±15 kV air discharge)
* Multi-line array preferred to minimise board area; low capacitance (≤ 1 pF/ch) to preserve signal integrity
* Place as close as physically possible to the connector body, before any series resistors or downstream logic

**Selected device:** Texas Instruments **TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1** — 4-channel, 0.5 pF/ch, ±15 kV
IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4, USON-10 (U-DFN-10). Same part as `D3` (PM) and `U4`–`U6` (CTL);
no new part numbers required. Placement per `Global_Routing_Spec.md §9` with DEC-045 hot-swap exception.

**Device placement — 8× per rotor pair (4 Board A + 4 Board B), 240× system total:**

| Ref | Board | Protects | Channels used |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| U5 | A | J1 JTAG input | `TDI`, `TMS`, `TCK` (1 spare channel) |
| U6 | A | J3 encoder input (array 1 of 3) | `ENC_IN[3:0]` |
| U7 | A | J3 encoder input (array 2 of 3) | `ENC_IN[5:4]`, `ENC_OUT[1:0]` |
| U8 | A | J3 encoder input (array 3 of 3) | `ENC_OUT[5:2]` |
| U9 | B | J4 JTAG output | `TDO`, `TMS`, `TCK` (1 spare channel) |
| U10 | B | J6 encoder output (array 1 of 3) | `ENC_IN[3:0]` |
| U11 | B | J6 encoder output (array 2 of 3) | `ENC_IN[5:4]`, `ENC_OUT[1:0]` |
| U12 | B | J6 encoder output (array 3 of 3) | `ENC_OUT[5:2]` |
