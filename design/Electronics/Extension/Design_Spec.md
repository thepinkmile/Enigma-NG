# Extension Board (V1.0) Design Specification

**Status:** Draft
**Project:** Enigma-NG
**Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot
**Version:** v.0.1.0
**Associated Hardware Revision:** Rev A
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-26

## 1. Overview

The Extension Board acts as a mid-stack JTAG signal repeater, power injection point, and
group-boundary actuation host between 5-rotor sub-groups in extended rotor configurations. It
buffers TCK and TMS drive signals, bridges the reflector-boundary service bus between groups, and
hosts one shared Actuation Module (AM) so a local carry / notch event can trigger the next 5-rotor
group without Controller-side live servo control.

* **Role:** Mechanical anchor and Power Injection for 5-rotor groups.
* **Capacity:** Up to ×5 Extension boards in a full 30-rotor build (Rev A power budget). Rev A
  prototype validates with 1 Extension board (10 rotors). Minimum configuration requires 0 Extensions
  (5 rotors: Stator → [5 Rotors] → Reflector). Each Extension board adds one further group of 5
  rotors. The 30-rotor / 5-extension limit is a power budget constraint — the architecture is
  theoretically scalable beyond 30 rotors with increased power.

## 2. Connectivity

* **Extension Port (J7 IN / J8 OUT):** 30-pin 2×15 shrouded box header.
  > **Connector Definition Owner:** `Stator/Board_Layout.md — J10`.
  > This board uses the mating connector on both J7 and J8 (Adam Tech 2BHR-30-VUA — see BOM).
  > Authoritative pinout per DEC-053: `5V_MAIN` on pins 1–2 and 29–30, `3V3_ENIG` on pins 3–4 and 27–28,
  > `ENC_OUT_REF[5:0]` on pins 7–12, `ENC_IN_REF[5:0]` on pins 19–24, `SYS_RESET_N` on pin 15,
  > `TTD_RETURN` on pin 16, GND guard pairs on pins 5–6, 13–14, 17–18, 25–26.
  > **Per DEC-043 then DEC-053:** The Extension Port was first widened from 16-pin to 20-pin (DEC-043)
  > and then from 20-pin to 30-pin (DEC-053) to resolve a power current budget violation.
* **Rotor Interface Connectors(3 per rotor-facing side × 2 sides = 6 connectors total):**
  The Extension board provides ERM8 male headers on the **input side** (J1–J3, plugging into the
  previous rotor group's last rotor J4/J5/J6 ERF8 output sockets) and ERF8 female sockets on the
  **output side** (J4–J6, receiving the next rotor group's first rotor J1/J2/J3 ERM8 male headers).

  > **Connector Definition Owner:** `Rotor/Design_Spec.md §3.4`.
  > This board uses ERM8 male headers on the input side and ERF8 female sockets on the output side:

  | Ref | Side | Signal Group | Type | MPN |
  | --- | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --- |
  | J1 | Input (plugs into previous group's last rotor J4) | JTAG | ERM8-005 (10-pin, 0.8mm pitch, **male**) | ERM8-005-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
  | J2 | Input (plugs into previous group's last rotor J5) | Power (3V3_ENIG × 5, GND × 5) — **power pins NC on this board** | ERM8-005 (10-pin, 0.8mm pitch, **male**) | ERM8-005-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
  | J3 | Input (plugs into previous group's last rotor J6) | ENC Data (ENC_IN/ENC_OUT + GND) | ERM8-010 (20-pin, 0.8mm pitch, **male**) | ERM8-010-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
  | J4 | Output (receives next group's first rotor J1) | JTAG | ERF8-005 (10-pin, 0.8mm pitch, female) | ERF8-005-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
  | J5 | Output (receives next group's first rotor J2) | Power (3V3_ENIG × 5, GND × 5) | ERF8-005 (10-pin, 0.8mm pitch, female) | ERF8-005-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
  | J6 | Output (receives next group's first rotor J3) | ENC Data (ENC_IN/ENC_OUT + GND) | ERF8-010 (20-pin, 0.8mm pitch, female) | ERF8-010-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |

  > **J2 power pins (3V3_ENIG and GND) are not connected to the board power plane.** J2 is present
  > for mechanical engagement with the upstream rotor group only. The Extension board's sole power
  > entry is J7 (Extension Port IN; `3V3_ENIG` on pins 3–4 and 27–28, `5V_MAIN` on pins 1–2 and 29–30,
  > and GND returns on pins 5–6, 13–14, 17–18, 25–26). This prevents a parallel power
  > path / ground loop between the rotor daisy-chain and the Extension Port ribbon. C1–C5 (10µF × 5,
  > star/spoke) decouple `3V3_ENIG` at the J7 power entry. C7–C11 (10µF × 5, star/spoke) decouple
  > `5V_MAIN` at the J7 power entry (pins 1–2 and 29–30), providing equivalent bulk buffering for both supply
  > rails. `3V3_ENIG` is passed to the downstream rotor group via J5 (driven from J7), while `5V_MAIN`
  > is used locally for the Extension-mounted Actuation Module and **forwarded to J8 pins 1–2 and 29–30** for
  > the next Extension board in chain.

  **Note:** The ERM8/ERF8 0.8mm pitch is physically incompatible with 2.54mm connectors — label distinctly on silkscreen.

* **JTAG Signal Buffering:** The Extension board provides JTAG re-buffering for the 5-rotor group
  connected to its output side (J4–J6). A **74LVC2G125** dual-channel 3-state buffer (U1) buffers the
  **TCK and TMS** lines, providing a fresh drive from the Extension board's 3V3_ENIG rail:
  * TCK buffer output → J4 pin **2** (TCK) and broadcast to all 5 rotors in the output group.
  * TMS buffer output → J4 pin **4** (TMS) and broadcast.
  * Buffer enable (OE#): tied to GND permanently (always enabled).
  * Part: SN74LVC2G125DCUR (TI, VSSOP-8) — Mouser 595-SN74LVC2G125DCUR,
    DigiKey 296-SN74LVC2G125DCURCT-ND, JLCPCB C21404.
  * At 5 rotors per group connected via BtB (ERM8/ERF8), signal integrity analysis confirms this
    buffer interval is sufficient: 5 rotors × EPM570T100I5N input capacitance (≈6pF) + connector capacitance
    ≈ 30–40pF total load; well within the 50ns half-period at 10MHz TCK.
* **GND_CHASSIS Single-Point Bond:** Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5`, the
  Extension board implements a local `GND_CHASSIS` net tied to its mounting holes and any
  deliberate enclosure-contact features, but it does **not** implement a local GND-to-GND_CHASSIS
  bond. J7/J8 pin 16 remains signal/power return only; the system's only galvanic GND ↔
  GND_CHASSIS bond is on the Power Module at the common power-entry point immediately before the
  eFuse.
* **Power Injection:** Receives `3V3_ENIG`, `5V_MAIN`, and return capacity via Extension Port to
  prevent voltage sag across long stacks and to power the local Actuation Module.
* Decoupling and bulk entry capacitor requirements per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3`.
* **JTAG TTD_RETURN / TDI:** TTD_RETURN (TDO chain return) is carried passively via Extension Port
  pin 15. TDI passes unbuffered board-to-board via BtB throughout the rotor stack — no series
  resistors are placed at each BtB hop. The JTAG chain terminates at the Reflector (R1 22 Ω
  end-of-chain damping). TTD_RETURN then returns from the Reflector to the Stator via the
  dedicated Reflector J4 → Stator J10 ribbon cable. The 75 Ω series resistors on the Stator
  (R7–R12, R27–R32, R33–R38) and Encoder boards (R6) are for the **encoder ribbon cable ports**
  (J4–J9) only —
  they are NOT placed on the BtB rotor stack interface. See
  `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md` and DEC-016.
  TCK and TMS are actively re-buffered by U1 (see JTAG Signal Buffering above).
* **SYS_RESET_N:** Received via Extension Port pin 2; broadcast to all local rotor CPLDs in this group.
* **Actuation Module host docks:** The Extension provides two local host sockets for one shared
  Actuation Module:
  * **J9** - AM power dock (`5V_MAIN`, `3V3_ENIG`, `GND`)
  * **J10** - AM trigger dock (`ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` + guards / returns)
  * The mounted AM footprint on the Extension is a no-component zone apart from J9 / J10 themselves
    and the routing / copper needed to reach them.
  * `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` is an active-low GPIO signal sourced either from the CM5 on the Controller
    Board or from the non-homing switch on the Extension Board itself. The line is held HIGH by the
    STM32G071K8T3TR internal GPIO pull-up on the Actuation Module (no external pull-up resistor is
    fitted). Exact switch mounting geometry remains owned by the mechanical design.
* **Cross-ref:** For interconnect pinouts on power (3V3_ENIG/GND), `ENC_OUT_REF` / `ENC_IN_REF`, and
  JTAG TTD_RETURN lines used for reflector loopback/plugboard mapping, See:
  * `Stator/Design_Spec.md`
  * `Reflector/Design_Spec.md`

## 3. Branding

* **Identity:** 2oz Copper / Inverted White Data Plate (V1.0 traceability).

## 4. PCB Fabrication & Stackup

* **Layers:** 4-Layer (JLC04161H-7628).
* **Finish:** ENIG (Gold) for connector surfaces.
* **Layer Mapping:** L1: Signal (JTAG pass-through / routing) | L2: GND | L3: 3V3_ENIG | L4: Signal (Data Plate).
* **Aesthetics:** Dark Green Solder Mask; Typewriter font (ALL-CAPS GERMAN).
* **JTAG Trace Width Rule:** The Extension board carries only the **TTD_RETURN** signal on its J7/J8 pass-through path
  (TCK, TMS, and TDI travel to the rotor stack via Stator J1–J3, not via the Extension Port). TTD_RETURN traces on L1 shall be routed at **0.127 mm (5 mil)**
  over the L2 GND plane, targeting **50 Ω controlled impedance**. See
  `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md` and DEC-016. Stackup defined per DEC-017.
* **U1 Bypass:** C6 (100nF) must be placed within 2mm of U1 VCC pin on L1.

## 5. Thermal & ESD

* **Thermal:** No active cooling required on the Extension board. U1 (SN74LVC2G125DCUR) is the
  only active IC; it dissipates <10mW and requires no heatsinking. C6 (0.1µF X7R 0402) provides
  the mandatory local bypass. All other components are passive.

  > ⚠️ **U1 must never be removed.** The Extension board actively re-buffers TCK and TMS for
  > every 5-rotor group. Without U1, signal integrity in long rotor stacks will fail.
  > See FR-EXT-01, DR-EXT-04/05/06.
* **ESD — rotor-facing connectors (TVS required):**
  J1/J3 (input side, ERM8 male) and J4/J6 (output side, ERF8 female) are exposed to operator handling during live rotor
  insertion and removal. Both sides of every hot-swap BtB interface are protected per DEC-045 and DEC-048:
  * **U2** — 1× TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 on J1 (JTAG in); channels: TCK, TMS, TTD, SYS_RESET_N.
  * **U3, U4, U5** — 3× TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 on J3 (ENC in); 12 channels: ENC_IN[5:0] + ENC_OUT[5:0].
  * **U6** — 1× TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 on J4 (JTAG out); channels: TCK, TMS, TTD, SYS_RESET_N.
  * **U7, U8, U9** — 3× TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 on J6 (ENC out); 12 channels: ENC_IN[5:0] + ENC_OUT[5:0].
  Per DEC-045, all Samtec ERM8/ERF8 rotor-facing connectors require TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 arrays.
  All arrays shall be placedwithin 3mm of their respective connector mating edge on L1.
* **ESD — all other connectors (no TVS required):**
  * J2 (Power in, ERM8-005) and J5 (Power out, ERF8-005): power rail (3V3_ENIG / GND) only — no signal protection required (explicitly outside DEC-048 scope — power-only rails, no signal data).
  * J7, J8 (Extension Port ribbons, 2BHR-30-VUA): internal IDC connectors; not accessible during live rotor swap.
  * J9, J10 (AM service docks, ERF8-005): service-only; not operator-swapped under live conditions (explicitly outside DEC-048 scope).
  Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §9`.
