## 2. Core Logic

* **Role:** Converts the CM5's USB 2.0 signals into standard JTAG signalling (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO) commands.
* **Bridge IC:** [FT232H datasheet](../../Datasheets/FT232H-datasheet.md) - High-Speed USB 2.0 to MPSSE.
* **Function:** Dedicated JTAG programmer for the global chain (30x Rotor CPLDs + 6x Encoder CPLDs + 1x Stator CPLD).
* **Configuration:** 12MHz crystal-controlled for stable JTAG programming via the CM5. See DEC-022.
* **Software Stack:** `ftdi_sio` kernel module for USB enumeration; `OpenOCD` with `libftdi` for JTAG/MPSSE
  operation (no custom driver required). CM5 enumerates the FT232H on Linux boot via `ftdi_sio`.

## 3. Interface & Wiring

### J1 — INPUT Header (5-Pin, USB/Power Side)

* **Type:** Single-row 2.54mm pitch male pin header, 5 pins
* **Pinout:** Pin 1 = 5V_USB | Pin 2 = 3V3_ENIG | Pin 3 = D+ | Pin 4 = D− | Pin 5 = GND
* **Purpose:** System power in (5V_USB + GND from Controller Board TPS2065C-protected USB rail);
  JTAG signal voltage reference (3V3_ENIG from Controller Board); internal USB 2.0 data to CM5 (D+/D−)
* **Physical location:** One edge of the board (INPUT side)
* **Mating Part (Controller J12):** Adam Tech RS1-05-G — 1×5 2.54mm female socket (JLCPCB C3321119)

### J2 — JTAG OUTPUT Header (10-Pin)

* **Type:** Single-row 2.54mm pitch male pin header, 10 pins
* **Physical location:** Opposing edge of the board (OUTPUT side), physically opposite J1
* **Mating Part (Controller J13):** Adam Tech RS1-10-G — 1×10 2.54mm female socket (JLCPCB C3320525)

> **No external connectors:** The JDB has no external connectors. USB is entirely internal via J1.
> No USB-C connector exists on the JDB. CC pins are irrelevant (USB 2.0 only).

### J2 JTAG Pinout (10-Pin, Interleaved GND)

| Pin | Signal | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | TCK | JTAG Clock |
| 2 | GND | Ground |
| 3 | TDI | JTAG Data In |
| 4 | GND | Ground |
| 5 | TDO | JTAG Data Out |
| 6 | GND | Ground |
| 7 | TMS | JTAG Mode Select |
| 8 | GND | Ground |
| 9 | VREF (3V3_ENIG) | Voltage Reference |
| 10 | GND | Ground |

### FT232H JTAG Signal Mapping (MPSSE Mode)

* AD0 → **TCK** (Clock)
* AD1 → **TDI** (Data In)
* AD2 → **TDO** (Data Out)
* AD3 → **TMS** (State Machine)

### Voltage

3.3V logic level (VCCIO = 3V3_ENIG). FT232H VCC = 5V_USB. 5V-tolerant I/O.

### GND_CHASSIS Single-Point Bond

Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5`, the JDB is exempt from the local
`GND_CHASSIS` requirement because it is a board-mounted daughterboard that does **not** connect
directly to the enclosure. Its mounting holes / conductive standoffs therefore tie to **GND**
only, not to a standalone `GND_CHASSIS` net. The system's only galvanic GND ↔ GND_CHASSIS bond
remains on the Power Module at the common power-entry point immediately before the eFuse.

## 4. Aesthetics & Mounting

* **Visibility:** Completely hidden internally.
* **Mounting:** Small **4-layer** PCB (DEC-017) mounted as a hat on the Controller Board via conductive
  standoffs. As a non-chassis-connected daughterboard, its mounting holes tie to **GND** only.

## 5. PCB Fabrication & Stackup

**Stackup:** JLC04161H-7628 (JLCPCB standard 4-layer, same as all other non-CTL/PM boards in the system)

| Layer | Role | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| L1 | GND plane + SMT component pads (component side) | Faces toward the Controller Board when JDB is mounted as a hat |
| L2 | All signal traces (inner layer) | Shielded between L1 GND reference and L3 power |
| L3 | Power distribution pours (5V_USB + 3V3_ENIG) | Inner power layer |
| L4 | GND pour shield | Faces away from the Controller (exterior/top when mounted) |

**Rationale:** Board mounts face-down on Controller (L1 toward Controller PCB). L4 GND provides exterior
shielding. L2 signals are sandwiched between two reference planes for good signal integrity. Single-side
assembly on L1 is consistent with JLCPCB SMT assembly requirements.

> **Note — Inverted Stackup:** The JDB uses an intentionally inverted 4-layer assignment (L1=GND, L2=signals, L3=power, L4=GND) vs. the standard
> pattern (L1=signal, L2=GND, L3=power, L4=signal). Placing signals on L2 immediately adjacent to the L1 GND plane achieves equivalent controlled
> impedance to outer-layer microstrip, consistent with DEC-016. See `Board_Layout.md §7.1` for JTAG trace impedance compliance detail.

## 6. Electrical Requirements

* **Power Architecture:**
  * FT232H VCC = **5V_USB** (5V) via hat-header J1 Pin 1 — from the Controller Board's TPS2065C-protected
    USB power rail (same current-limited rail as the USB 3.0 ports, 1.6A limit).
  * FT232H VCCIO = **3V3_ENIG** (3.3V) via hat-header J1 Pin 2 — sets JTAG signal voltage to match
    CPLD I/O logic levels (same role as CM5 GPIO reference voltage).
  * FT232H VBUS pin tied to **5V_USB** (always-on; USB connection to CM5 is internal — no VBUS monitoring needed).
  * USB connection is **entirely internal**: D+ and D− travel from FT232H via J1 hat-header through the
    Controller Board PCB directly to the CM5 USB 2.0 port. No USB-C connector on the JDB.
  * FT232H operates in **self-powered USB mode** — power from system (5V_USB), not from USB host.
  * CM5 enumerates the FT232H when Linux boots and ftdi_sio loads; no JDB-side power sequencing required.
  * Controller TPS2065C is the upstream current limiter; no additional current limiter on JDB.
* **Bulk Capacitor Exception:** The JDB is exempt from the standard 5× bulk entry bank rule. The Controller
  Board upstream provides a fully-bypassed power rail. Per-IC decoupling per FT232H datasheet: C1–C4, C6–C9
  = 8× 100nF (one per FT232H supply pin: VCCA, VCORE, VCCD, VCCIO×3, VPLL, VPHY) plus a single 4.7µF
  entry filter (C5) on 5V_USB.
* **FT232H RESET_N Biasing:** R3 (10kΩ) pulls FT232H RESET_N (pin 34) to 3V3_ENIG, ensuring the chip
  remains deasserted (RESET_N HIGH = normal operation) at all times during normal use. RESET_N is active-low;
  if left floating the pin may latch LOW and prevent the FT232H from operating. An external pull-up is
  required per FTDI application note AN_108 when RESET_N is not driven by the host (see DR-JDB-16).
* **Clocking:** Dedicated 12MHz SMD crystal (Y1) for the FT232H reference clock. The FT232H internal PLL requires 12MHz; CM5 GPCLK
  option was considered and rejected — see DEC-022. Crystal load capacitors C10–C11 (33pF C0G) set the 20pF crystal load capacitance.
  **Load cap calculation:** The crystal specifies C_L = 20pF. Two equal load caps in series give C_series = C/2; adding PCB stray
  capacitance (C_stray ≈ 3–4pF, from PCB traces and FT232H XTIN input capacitance) yields:
  C_L = C/2 + C_stray = 33/2 + 3.5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.5 = **20pF ✓**
  33pF C0G is therefore the correct value. Do not change to 15pF (which would give C_L ≈ 7.5 + 3.5 = 11pF, far below spec).
* **JTAG Signal Integrity:**
  * **R2 (33Ω):** Series termination on FT232H TDI output, placed within 2mm of the FT232H TDI pin.
    TDI drives only the first CPLD in the chain (single load) — source termination at the FT232H pin
    provides matched drive (FT232H output ≈ 20Ω + R2 33Ω ≈ 53Ω) for the board-to-board path.
    Per DEC-016 intra-board/BtB termination rule. See `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md`.
  * **R8 (33Ω):** Series damping on TDI signal (not buffered) before J2 (TDI pin). Combined with R2 at FT232H, provides damping at both ends of the FT232H-to-J2 TDI path.
  * **U5 (SN74LVC2G125DCUR, VSSOP-8):** Dual-channel 3-state buffer placed between the FT232H and
    J2 header (JTAG OUTPUT), buffering TCK and TMS for the 37-device JTAG chain load. TDI is not
    buffered — FT232H TDI drives only the first device in the chain directly.
  * **R6 (33Ω):** Series damping on U5 TCK output, placed within 2mm of the U5 output pin, before
    J2 JTAG header (TCK pin). Source impedance after U5: U5_out (≈15Ω) + R6 (33Ω) ≈ 48Ω — matched
    to 50Ω BtB trace impedance per DEC-024.
  * **R7 (33Ω):** Series damping on U5 TMS output — same function as R6 (TCK). Placed before J2 (TMS pin).
  * **Pull Resistors:** TMS 10kΩ pull-up (R4) and TCK 10kΩ pull-down (R5) near J2 header to hold JTAG TAP in defined state
    when idle (see §5 and JTAG best-practice note in `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md`).
  * **Trace Width Rule:** All JTAG signal traces on L2 (signal layer) shall be routed at **0.127 mm (5 mil)** over the L1 GND reference plane, targeting **50 Ω controlled impedance**. See DEC-016.

> **Signal Integrity note (JDB as complete JTAG master):** The JDB hosts all JTAG buffering and
> termination for the system. U5 buffers TCK and TMS for the 37-device chain load. Series damping
> (R6–R8) at 33 Ω matches the BtB trace impedance (50 Ω) per DEC-016. The Controller `J5` ↔ Stator
> `J12` logic dock is a direct board-to-board connection (no cable) — 33 Ω applies throughout (not
> the 75 Ω cable-driving rule).
> The Controller board routes JTAG lines as pass-through without active components. See DEC-024.

## 7. Thermal & ESD

* **Thermal:** Low-power debug board; no thermal management required.
* **ESD:** No TVS/ESD protection required — all connectors (J1, J2) are internal hat-headers, per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §9`.
