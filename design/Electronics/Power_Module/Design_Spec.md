# Power Module (V1.0) Design Specification

**Status:** Draft
**Project:** Enigma-NG
**Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot
**Version:** v.0.1.0
**Associated Hardware Revision:** Rev A
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-26

## 1. Overview

This Power Module is a custom power board that is independently shielded and protected to ensure all power sources are filtered, controlled and monitored.
It provides the basis of the clean power rails into the controller board and other peripheral boards.
It produces 2 power rails from a common ~12V input source. These power rails are:

* **5V_MAIN** Providing up to 12A for powering the CM5 module (dual-phase interleaved LMQ61460AFSQRJRRQ1).
* **3V3_ENIG** Providing clean 3.3V power for CPLDs, USB-JTAG VCCIO, I2C logic, status
  indicator logic, and the full rotor stack.

**NOTE:** The **3V3_ENIG** rail (generated on this Power Module by the TPS75733 LDO) is the unified 3.3V rail supplying
CPLDs, USB-JTAG logic/VCCIO, and low-voltage control/telemetry domains. `3V3_ENIG` crosses to the
Controller Board via dock connector `J1`.

* **Controller Dock:** The Power Module docks into the Controller through three TE 10-position
  connectors: `J1` (regulated rails), `J2` (regulated PoE-derived auxiliary feed), and `J3`
  (low-speed control / telemetry).
  * **Provided to Controller:** `5V_MAIN`, `3V3_ENIG`, PM telemetry, `PWR_GD`, and `PWR_BUT`.
  * **Received from Controller:** `VIN_POE_12V`, `I2C-1`, `PM_IO_INT_N` return path, `ROTOR_EN_N`, and `LED_nPWR`.
  * **Cross-ref:** See `Controller/Design_Spec.md` and `Controller/Board_Layout.md` for the active dock allocation.
  * **Reference datasheets:** [`TE-1123684-7-datasheet.md`](../../Datasheets/TE-1123684-7-datasheet.md),
    [`TE-1-1674231-1-datasheet.md`](../../Datasheets/TE-1-1674231-1-datasheet.md)

>
### 1. PCB Architecture

* **Stackup:** 6-Layer / 2oz Finished Copper (JLC06161H-2116).
  For production runs requiring verified controlled impedance, specify JLCPCB's 'Controlled Impedance'
  service (TDR-verified, ±10% tolerance). Prototype orders may omit this service per DEC-017
  (calculated trace widths within ±10% of target based on JLC06161H-2116 datasheet parameters).
* **Substrate:** High-Tg FR4 for thermal stability.
* **Finish:** ENIG (Gold) for all user-touch points and thermal pads.
* **Enclosure:** ≥30mm internal clearance Aluminium "Power Can" with internal compression ribs
  (≥30mm required above PCB surface to clear ADCR-T02R7SA256MB supercap bodies at 27.0mm max height + assembly margin).
* **Thermal:** Cross-Hatched Exposed ENIG "Thermal Halos" (2mm offset) at mesh intersections.
  * **Vias:** Type VII (Epoxy-filled & Capped) Hexagonal Thermal Via Matrix.
* **Supercap Block:** 2×4 arrangement (8 cells, 20mm centre-to-centre pitch, 3.5mm air gap between cells
  at max body diameter 16.5mm). Block footprint ≈ 41mm × 77mm. THT through-holes: 7.5mm lead pitch
  (±0.5mm), 1.0mm recommended drill diameter (0.8mm lead diameter).
  The 3.0mm gap is a 'No-Fly Zone' for all PCB traces on L1–L6 (enclosure rib clearway).
  * **Rib Clearway ENIG Bond:** Solder mask is opened in the 3.0mm rib clearway gap on L1 (top copper),
    connected to GND_CHASSIS. Minimum strip width 1.5mm × full rib contact depth. The aluminium enclosure
    rib makes direct electrical contact via a conductive elastomer gasket strip (≤3mm wide, self-adhesive;
    part selected at mechanical design phase). Supercap bodies are wrapped in minimum 2-mil (50µm) polyimide
    (Kapton) tape before installation to prevent shorts with the metal ribs. Combined with the GND_CHASSIS
    copper pour in the shadow zone (§1 keepout rule), this creates a near-complete Faraday cage around the
    supercap block. See DEC-020.
* **Routing Keep-out:** 41mm × 81mm shadow zone on L1–L6 beneath the Supercap Block — only GND_CHASSIS copper and Type VII thermal vias permitted within this zone.

### 2. Power & UPS Hub

* **Storage:** LTC3350-managed supercap bank — 8× Abracon ADCR-T02R7SA256MB (25F/2.7V, THT radial can, 16.0mm dia × 25.0mm height) in 2S4P configuration on 5V_MAIN bus. Total: 50F at 5.4V. Hold-up
  energy: 503J (≥33.5 seconds at 15W CM5 shutdown load). Supercap manager: LTC3350 (QFN-38, 5×7mm), handles charging, cell balancing, and hold-up switchover.
* **PoE Auxiliary Interface:** `J2` receives the regulated PoE-derived auxiliary feed
  (`VIN_POE_12V` + `GND`) from the Controller. The Controller hosts the RJ45, Ethernet ESD, and
  PoE PD / ACF front-end.
* **Battery Interface:** 5-pin Locking Micro-Fit (Molex 43650-0519 — vertical THT, gold contacts, board lock).
  * Pin 1: `VBATT+` (14.4V nominal).
  * Pin 2: `SMBUS_SCL` with local ESD protection.
  * Pin 3: `SMBUS_SDA` with local ESD protection.
  * Pin 4: `BATT_PRES_N` (battery `T` / auxiliary detect pin for the selected smart-battery family).
  * Pin 5: `VBATT-`.
  * **BMS Charge Voltage:** Smart Battery BMS must be configured for a maximum charge voltage of **4.1V/cell (16.4V total for 4S)**. This provides a ≥0.5V margin to the TPS25980 eFuse 16.9V OVLO
  threshold, preventing nuisance latch-off at full charge. BMS configurations using 4.2V/cell (16.8V) are not compatible without OVLO re-specification.
  * **Candidate replacement path:** a military / NetWarrior-style Glenair or ODU receptacle plus a
    small PM-side interposer board is now being investigated as a possible replacement for the Molex
    part. See `Millitary_Battery_Connection_Option.md`. This remains **pending** confirmation of the
    6-pin contact map, cable availability, and interposer mechanics. The `Y` keying for the chosen
    Glenair candidate is already verified as the standard battery keying intended to prevent mating
    with data-only ports on standard in-service devices. ODU offers a compatible alternative socket
    matching the Glenair form; supplier responses are pending.
* **Presence Logic:** Pin 4 (`BATT_PRES_N`) is pulled to **3V3_ENIG** via 10kΩ resistor (R6). For the selected Accutronics / Inspired Energy N205-family battery, the battery `T` pin presents
  **300Ω ±5% to `VBATT-`**, which is treated directly as battery-present.
  * Logic HIGH: Battery Disconnected.
  * Logic LOW: Battery Detected.
  * Other battery families that do not expose a compatible auxiliary / thermistor pin must be adapted externally rather than changing the PM base pinout.
* **Protection:** TPD1E10B06DYARQ1 TVS diode on the Presence line plus a dedicated 2-channel TVS array on the SMBus lines to protect the battery interface during insertion.
* **Stabilizer:** Solder-mask opening "KLEBER-ZONE" for RTV Silicone adhesive.
* **Indicators:** Green "LOGIK-BEREIT" LED + 5.1V Zener Amber "Safety Glow" LED.
* **Z-Height:** Through-hole radial can supercapacitors (ADCR-T02R7SA256MB, 16.0mm nominal / 16.5mm max dia ×
  25.0mm nominal / 27.0mm max height); enclosure above PM PCB must provide ≥30mm internal vertical clearance for supercap bodies.
* **Interface:** Gelid GP-Ultimate (15 W/mK) pad on an **Exposed ENIG** bottom zone to Aluminium Enclosure with internal compression ribs.

### 3. Telemetry & Power Management

* **I2C Telemetry:** 4.7kΩ (1%) pull-up resistors (**R7, R8**) on SDA/SCL lines, tied to **3V3_ENIG**.
* **PM-local GPIO Expander:** `PCA9534APWR` (U16) at I²C address **0x3F**.
  * **Inputs:** `POE_STAT`, `SYS_FAULT`, `BATT_PRES_N`, `USB_STAT`
  * **Outputs:** `SW_LED_R`, `SW_LED_G`, `SW_LED_B`, `SW_LED_CTRL`
  * **Interrupt:** Open-drain `PM_IO_INT_N` exported to the Controller on `J3`.
  * **Power-up state:** All pins default to inputs, so the pre-boot hardware orange flash path remains dominant until firmware reconfigures the expander.
  * **Reference datasheet:** [`pca9534a-datasheet.md`](../../Datasheets/pca9534a-datasheet.md)
* **5V_MAIN Current Monitor:**
  * **Purpose:** Provides real-time current/voltage telemetry for the 5V_MAIN rail to the CM5.
  * **Sensor:** TI INA219AIDR (U12) zero-drift power monitor at I²C address **0x40**.
  * **Placement:** Inserted in the 5V_MAIN supply path on L1, downstream of the eFuse (TPS25980).
  * **Shunt:** CSS2H-2512R-R010ELF (10mΩ ±1% 5A, 2512 Kelvin-sense) — PM R23 instance.
    (Stator R1 is the third system CSS2H; total build qty: 3 — see `Power_Budgets.md`.)
  * **Interface:** I2C-1 Telemetry Bus, directly accessible via `J3` to the Controller.
  * **Filtering:** 0.1µF VCC decoupling (C43) and RC input filter on IN+/IN-: R52 (10Ω RF1, series on IN+), R53 (10Ω RF2, series on IN-),
    C52 (100nF CF, differential across IN+/IN-); f_3dB ≈ 80kHz (differential). Suppresses PM buck switching transients (400kHz and harmonics).
    See INA219 datasheet Figure 14.
  * Satisfies FR-PM-05.
* **Interrupt Bias:** 10kΩ (1%) pull-up (**R9**) on `PM_IO_INT_N` so the PM-local expander interrupt
  idles HIGH when U16 is quiescent.
* **Battery Detection:** `BATT_PRES_N` is reported through U16 (`PCA9534A @ 0x3F`) and exported over I²C.
* **Direct CM5 power-state signal:** `LED_nPWR` is received from the Controller over `J3` and used only by
  the local SW2 hardware indicator logic. It is not routed through U16.

### 4. EMI & Filtering (The "Iron Curtain")

The input filter uses a two-stage common-mode (CM) choke cascade followed by a differential-mode (DM) Pi-filter. This architecture addresses both CM and DM conducted noise across the full EN 55032
Class B frequency range (150kHz–30MHz).

**Filter Topology (power flow left → right):**

```text
VIN_RAW ─┬─[L1: WE-CMBNC CM Choke]─[L2: WE-CMBNC HF CM Choke]─┬─[L3: 10µH DM]─┬─ VIN_BUS (to eFuse)

GND ──────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────┴─ GND
```

> **Note:** L1 and L2 are common-mode chokes — each has two coupled windings,
> one in the +VIN line and one in the GND return line. C1/C2 + C21 + C24 form
> the input-side Pi-filter capacitor stack, and C3/C4 + C22 + C25 form the
> output-side stack. All are shunt capacitors to GND
> (differential filter caps).

**Stage 1 — Primary CMC (L1: Würth WE-CMBNC 7448031002):**

* Part: **L1 = Würth WE-CMBNC 7448031002** — nanocrystalline common-mode
  choke, 10A rated, 2mH CM inductance, 6.3mOhm DCR, 24 x 17 x 25mm THT. This
  is the locked BOM part for the primary CMC; no further part-selection
  verification is required unless a future redesign changes the filter
  strategy.
* Function: Broadband CM attenuation from ~1kHz to >10MHz. Nanocrystalline core maintains high permeability (µ_r > 50,000) well into the MHz range, providing >60dB CM insertion loss at 150kHz.

**Stage 2 — Secondary HF CMC (L2: Würth WE-CMBNC 7448031002):**

* Part: **L2 = Würth WE-CMBNC 7448031002** — same part as L1 (nanocrystalline
  CMC, THT, 10A, 2mH). Twin nanocrystalline CMCs provide broadband CM coverage
  from 1kHz to 30MHz. ⚠️ Re-evaluate at EMC pre-compliance test.
* Function: Supplementary CM attenuation above ~10MHz where nanocrystalline core permeability falls off. Provides a second CM filter pole to ensure >40dB CM attenuation to 30MHz+.
* **Fallback option:** If WE-CMBNC 7448031002 becomes unavailable, a ferrite-core CMC (e.g. Würth WE-CMB 744860220 or equivalent ≥10A ferrite THT CMC) may be substituted for L2 only.
  Ferrite CMCs have lower CM inductance below ~10kHz but perform equivalently above 1MHz. ⚠️ Re-verify CM insertion loss at 150kHz with the ferrite substitute before schematic freeze
  — add an external X2 cap (e.g. 10nF Y1-rated) across the CM choke if >6dB insertion loss is lost at 150kHz.

**Stage 3 — Differential Mode Pi-filter (L3 + C1/C2/C21/C24 and C3/C4/C22/C25):**

*Component selection:*

* **L3** — Bourns `SRP1265A-100M`: 10µH, 15.5A I_sat, 10A I_rms, DCR = 16.5mΩ max, 13.5×12.5×6.2mm shielded molded SMD.
* **C1-C15** — 22µF, 25V, X7R, 1210 (Samsung CL32B226KAJNNNE or equiv).
* **C16-C19** — 47µF, 25V, X7R, 2220 (TDK CGA9N3X7R1E476M230KB).
* **C20** — 10µF, 25V, X7R, 1206 (Kemet C1206C106K3RACTU or equiv).
* **C21-C23** — 1µF, 50V, X7R, 0805 (Kemet C0805C105K5RACTU or equiv).
* **C24-C39** — 100nF, 50V, X7R, 0402 (Samsung CL05B104KB5NNNC or equiv).

*Filter performance calculations:*

* Effective capacitance per Pi leg:
  `(C1+C2)||C21||C24 = 44µF + 1µF + 100nF ≈ 45.1µF` at the input leg, and
  `(C3+C4)||C22||C25 = 44µF + 1µF + 100nF ≈ 45.1µF` at the output leg.
* Pi-filter −3dB corner frequency:
  `f_c = 1/(2π√(L3 × C)) = 1/(2π × √(10µH × 45.1µF))` = **7.5kHz**.
* DM attenuation at 150kHz (EN 55032 Class B lower limit):
  40dBdec × log(150k/7.5k) ≈ **−52dB** ✓
* DM attenuation at 200kHz (representative upstream switcher / auxiliary-converter noise): ≈ **−57dB** ✓
* DM attenuation at 400kHz (LMQ61460AFSQRJRRQ1 buck switching): ≈ **−69dB** ✓
* Combined with dual CMC stages: total insertion loss well exceeds EN 55032 Class B limits across 150kHz–10MHz.

*Broadband capacitor stack rationale:*

* C1-C4 (22µF): bulk DM filtering at f_c and lower harmonics.
* C21/C22 (1µF): mid-frequency bypass; bridges impedance gap between 22µF ceramic SRF (~3MHz) and 100nF.
* C24/C25 (100nF): HF bypass; low impedance at >10MHz where bulk caps become inductive.
* All caps: 50V rating provides >3× voltage margin over 16.9V max input; X7R stable over −55°C to +125°C.

**Shielding:** Vintage Silver Aluminium enclosure screwed to `GND_CHASSIS` ears — provides a Faraday shield for the entire Power Module, supplementing conducted filtering with radiated attenuation.

> **Note on L1/L2 placement:** L1 and L2 are cascaded common-mode chokes on the **combined post-OR-ing bus** (VIN_RAW), not per-input filters.
> All three input sources (PoE, USB-C, Battery) are OR-ed first via Q1–Q3 and U6a/U6b/U6c, then the combined rail passes through L1→L2→L3 before reaching the eFuse (U1).
> Only the Battery input (J4) has no dedicated input-side ESD filter — D1/D2 provide transient protection at the connector.

### 5. Protection & Logic

* **External Handshake:** STUSB4500 (Standalone Sink) negotiates **15V/5A** (75W) from Wall adapter or USB-C PD source.
* **Internal Handshake:** TPS25751 PD Emulator (U4) provides a **5V/5A** "Clean PD" profile to the CM5 USB-C port to prevent OS throttling.
  U4 CC1/CC2 lines are routed through the Controller dock J1 power connector data-pin block to the CM5's CC pins on the Controller Board.
  No separate USB-C connector on the PM is required for this path.
* **Protection:** LM74700-Q1 controls the triple-input OR-ing network and drives Q1-Q3 PowerPAK ideal-diode FETs.
* **OR-ing Priority:** The PM OR-ing stage sees three input sources:
  Controller-fed `VIN_POE_12V`, local USB-C, and local Battery. The Controller
  handles PoE negotiation and exports the resulting regulated auxiliary rail to
  the PM, but the Power Module still performs the triple-input OR-ing / source
  selection before the selected input is passed into the eFuse path.
* **eFuse:** TPS259804ONRGER (16.9V OVLO silicon-fixed, VQFN 4×4mm) — 7A ILIM, 11.0V UVLO, 16.9V OVLO, 3mΩ RON (typ.).
  * UVLO / ILIM resistor network:
    * **R1** — 232kΩ `R_UVLO_HI` — 1% Thick-Film 0603.
    * **R2** — 28.7kΩ `R_UVLO_LO` — 1% Thick-Film 0603.
    * **R3** — 210Ω `R_ILIM` — 0.1% Thin-Film 0603.
    * Note: OVLO is silicon-fixed on TPS259804ONRGER — no external OVLO resistor required or present.
  * **Latch-off Recovery:** TPS25980 latches off on OVLO, UVLO, or sustained overcurrent. Recovery requires pulling the EN pin LOW (>1ms) then HIGH.
    **SW1 (power toggle switch) achieves this** — flip SW1 to OFF (EN pulled to GND via SW1 → eFuse latch reset), fix the fault condition,
    then flip SW1 back to ON (EN pulled HIGH via R22 to VIN_BUS → normal operation resumes). At least one input source (PoE, USB-C, or
    Battery) must remain present so VIN_BUS is available when the eFuse re-enables.
  * ⚠️ If all three input sources are simultaneously absent, the supercap bank must be recharged before the system will restart. No dedicated reset button is needed beyond SW1.
* **Supercap Manager:** LTC3350 (QFN-38, 5×7mm) on 5V_MAIN bus. Manages 8-cell bank (2S4P, 50F/5.4V); provides 0.5A soft-charge current limit; automatic hold-up switchover on 5V_MAIN loss.
  * **RICHARGE calculation:** `ICH = VICHARGE / (RICHARGE × RSENSE)` where:
    * `VICHARGE = 1.485V` (LTC3350 internal reference).
    * `RSENSE = 10mΩ` (R_SENSE, 2512 package, in charging path).
    * For `ICH = 0.5A`: `RICHARGE = 1.485V / (0.5A × 0.010Ω) = 297Ω → use 301Ω (E96, 1%, 0603)`.
  * ⚠️ **RICHARGE tolerance:** VICHARGE = 1.485V ±0.5% (LTC3350 spec);
    RICHARGE (R11, 301Ω, 1% thick-film) keeps combined error ≤±1.5%
    → charge current error ≤±3mA at 500mA target. This is negligible for supercap charging.
  * ⚠️ Verify Kelvin implementation and routing for **R12 (RSENSE)** as part of the PCB layout design process;
    * **R12 (RSENSE) must be a 4-terminal Kelvin-sense resistor** with independent sense traces to avoid trace resistance adding to the measured value (even 1mΩ trace adds 10% error on a 10mΩ sense resistor).
  * **Backup Trigger:** LTC3350 BACKUP pin activates hold-up mode when 5V_MAIN drops below the programmed threshold
    (resistor divider R14/R15 from 5V_MAIN to BACKUP pin; threshold = 1.2V × (R14+R15)/R15).
    * **Applied values (PM-06 revised, DEC-030):** R14=30.1kΩ (E96 0.1% thin-film) / R15=10.0kΩ → threshold = **4.812V** — 312mV *above*
      the MCP121T PWR_GD threshold (4.50V). LTC3350 backup activates **before** MCP121T can deassert `PWR_GD`,
      eliminating a PWR_GD glitch that would occur while the rail traverses the gap between the two thresholds. LTC3350
      immediately restores 5V_MAIN to 5V on activation; MCP121T never deasserts during the hold-up window. Graceful shutdown
      is triggered via the `/INTB` → MIC1555 U15 → `PWR_BUT` one-shot path (FR-PM-07), not by PWR_GD deassertion.
    * ⚠️ **Design note:** The 4.812V threshold is intentionally set *above* the 4.50V `PWR_GD` threshold because shutdown is
      hardware-triggered via `PWR_BUT`; this keeps `PWR_GD` stable throughout the hold-up interval.
    * Hold-up duration from fully-charged bank: ≥33.5 seconds at 15W CM5 graceful-shutdown load.
* **Controller-fed PoE Auxiliary Path:**
  * The IEEE 802.3bt PD / ACF front-end resides on the Controller.
  * The Power Module receives only the regulated auxiliary feed `VIN_POE_12V` on `J2`.
  * `VIN_POE_12V` is treated as the third OR-ing source alongside USB-C and Battery.
  * `POE_STAT` remains available to software through the PM-local `PCA9534A`.
  * **LDO Enable (ROTOR_EN_N — Active-LOW):**
  * `ROTOR_EN_N` (3.3V drive from the Controller) drives the TPS75733 (U7) EN pin. The TPS75733 has an **active-LOW enable** (EN LOW = enabled, EN HIGH = shutdown) — no level-shifting required.
  * A 10kΩ pull-**up** resistor (R10) from the EN pin to 3V3_ENIG holds the LDO **disabled** at startup (EN=HIGH=shutdown). This ensures the rotor stack remains de-energised while the CM5 is booting.
  * ROTOR_EN_N asserted (LOW by CM5) → LDO **enabled** → 3V3_ENIG present (CPLDs + rotor stack powered).
  * ROTOR_EN_N de-asserted (HIGH / released to pull-up) → LDO **disabled** → 3V3_ENIG off (all rotor and CPLD loads de-energised).
  * **Thermal Budget (TPS75733):**
    * V_dropout ≈ 0.18V (TPS75733 typical at 1.85A). Typical dissipation: **~0.33W** (1.85A load, Vdo≈0.18V).
    * At worst-case 2.05A load: P_diss ≈ 0.22V × 2.05A ≈ **~0.45W** worst-case.
    * Standard TO-263 package thermal pad and ground vias are sufficient at this dissipation level.
    * At 40°C ambient with standard PCB copper: T_J well within 125°C limit.
* **Monitoring:** MCP121T-450E supervisor asserts PWR_GD to the CM5 once the regulated 5V rail is stable.
  * "LOGIK-BEREIT" Green LED + 5.1V Zener "Safety Glow" (Amber LED) remains active during capacitor discharge.
* **Hardware Status Oscillator:** MIC1555 (U11, SOT-23-5) — CMOS timer providing the 1Hz hardware "Initialising" heartbeat pulse for the orange status LED, operating entirely independently of CM5
  firmware. Active from power-on until the Controller takes over the runtime status LED signals. Also serves as a visible supercap state-of-charge indicator during hold-up mode. Timing network: R16
(R_A=10kΩ), R17 (R_B=715kΩ), C23 (C_OSC=1µF) → f=1Hz, ~50% duty cycle.
* **PWR_BUT One-Shot (U15):** Second MIC1555 (SOT-23-5) configured as a monostable (one-shot) timer.
  Triggered by a falling edge on LTC3350 `/INTB` (R29 10kΩ pull-up to 3V3_ENIG keeps the line HIGH
  when idle). On trigger, U15 output goes HIGH for t = 1.1 × R28 × C42 = 1.1 × 274kΩ × 10µF ≈ **3.01 seconds**,
  driving Q5 (BSS138 N-FET) which pulls the `PWR_BUT` line LOW. The CM5 internal 10kΩ
  pull-up holds `PWR_BUT` HIGH at all other times. The 3-second pulse is centred in the 1–5 second PMIC
  power-key window — long enough to guarantee a graceful shutdown event, short enough to never trigger
  the PMIC hard power-off (>5–8 seconds). `PWR_BUT` is routed to the Controller Board via dock
  connector `J3` and connects to the CM5 PMIC power-button input.

### 6. Signal Integrity & Safety

> **Note:** The USB-C port (J5) is power-delivery only. No USB data lines, HDMI, RJ45, or GbE MDI routing are present on the Power Module.

* **ESD Protection:**
  * TPD4E05U06 (D3) at the USB-C entry.
  * TPD2E2U06 (D2) on the Battery SMBus lines (SDA/SCL).
  * TPD1E10B06DYARQ1 (D1) on the BATT_PRES_N Presence Detect line.
* **Grounding:** 4-layer GND_CHASSIS ring with 2.5mm staggered via-stitching around the board
  perimeter, tied to the board mounting holes and enclosure-contact features so the Power Module
  remains part of the global chassis domain.
* **Single-Point GND Bond:** Signal/power reference GND connects to GND_CHASSIS at one point only —
  at the common power-entry point immediately before the eFuse input (the clean/dirty power
  boundary), downstream of the source-selection / OR-ing stage so the bond location remains correct
  regardless of which input supply is active. See `Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5` and
  `Standards/Certification_Evidence.md §2.2` for full rationale.
* **Galvanic Isolation:** Any PoE galvanic-isolation requirement is satisfied on the Controller PoE
  front-end before `VIN_POE_12V` reaches the PM dock.

## 3. Power Sequencing & Hardware Reset

### 1. The "Safe-Start" Logic

To prevent the CM5 from attempting to boot during the 12V-15V "Enigma Rail" ramp-up, we use an automated voltage supervisor combined with a manual override.

* **Power Toggle (SW1):** Panel-mount latching rugged metal power switch with RGB ring LED
  (Adafruit 4660) connected to the TPS25980 eFuse **EN pin**, not the main VIN_BUS power line.
  When SW1 is open (ON position), R22 (10kΩ to VIN_BUS) holds EN HIGH → eFuse enabled. When SW1
  is closed (OFF position), EN is pulled to GND → eFuse output cut, all downstream power off.
  * **Current rating:** The EN contact is low-current logic only (microamp-scale load), but the
    selected front-panel hardware remains the Adafruit 4660 or an exact mechanical/electrical
    equivalent with the same 16mm panel fit, latching action, RGB ring interface, and 2.8mm
    terminal scheme.
  * **Mechanical / wiring:** Use the switch's 2.8mm pin terminals via six matching PCB-mounted
    2.8mm male spade tabs on the Power Module so the panel switch can be wired as a
    field-serviceable harnessed subassembly.
* **Supervisor IC:** [MCP121T-450E](https://www.microchip.com) (4.50V Threshold).
* **Trigger:** The supervisor monitors the **5V_MAIN** rail. It holds the `PWR_GD` pin LOW until the rail is stable.
* **Manual Power Button (SW2):** Panel-mount momentary rugged metal pushbutton with RGB ring LED
  (Adafruit 3350) wired directly from `PWR_BUT` to GND.
  * **Action:** A brief press (released within ~2 seconds) sends a power-button event to the CM5 PMIC.
    When the CM5 OS is halted but power is present, this wakes the CM5. When the OS is running, it
    triggers a graceful shutdown via Linux `systemd-logind` (equivalent to `sudo shutdown -h now`).
  * **Mechanical / wiring:** Same 16mm panel family and 2.8mm terminal scheme as SW1. Use matching
    PCB-mounted 0.110in male Quick-Fit tabs so SW2 is also a field-serviceable harnessed subassembly.
  * **Pull-up:** CM5 module integrates a 10kΩ pull-up on `PWR_BUT` — no external pull-up required.
  * **Note:** SW2 does not drive `PWR_GD`. The MCP121T-450E supervisor drives `PWR_GD`
    exclusively; no manual override of that net is provided.
* **RGB LED circuits:**
  * **SW1:**
    * SW1 integrates the primary RGB status ring.
    * Before CM5 boot, the MIC1555 oscillator (U11) drives the **Red and Green** hardware path via
      Q4 to produce a 1Hz orange flash.
    * After boot, the PM-local expander U16 (`PCA9534APWR @ 0x3F`) asserts `SW_LED_CTRL` and drives
      `SW_LED_R/G/B` through dedicated low-side sink stages `Q6/Q7/Q8`.
    * Runtime red is asserted when software detects a PM fault condition, including LTC3350-reported
      supercap bank states that mean the guaranteed hold-up window is unavailable.
    * BAT54 Schottky diodes (D6, D7) isolate the MIC1555/Q4 hardware path on the **Red and Green
      channels only**. Blue is runtime-only and is not part of the hardware flash path.
    * **LED colour scheme:**
      * Orange flash = booting;
      * Solid green = USB-C active;
      * Solid blue = PoE active;
      * Solid orange = Battery active;
      * Solid red = PM fault or hold-up unavailable.
  * **SW2:**
    * SW2 integrates a hardware-only CM5 state indicator ring.
    * `LED_nPWR` (CM5 pin 95, routed from the Controller on `J3`) is buffered / inverted on the PM to
      generate a local active-HIGH `CM5_PWR_ON` signal for the SW2 green channel.
    * Green ON = CM5 powered.
    * A LOW pulse on `PWR_BUT` while `CM5_PWR_ON` is active sets a local shutdown latch.
    * The shutdown latch gates the existing U11 1Hz oscillator into the SW2 red channel while green
      remains ON, producing a 1Hz green/orange indication during graceful shutdown.
    * When `LED_nPWR` deasserts, the shutdown latch clears and the SW2 LED turns OFF.

### 2. Startup Timeline

1. **Input:** 11–16.9V enters via Controller-fed `VIN_POE_12V`, USB-C (STUSB4500 negotiated 15V), or Battery (11–16.4V).
   All three sources are within the TPS25980 eFuse window (UVLO 11V / OVLO 16.9V).
2. **Gate:** TPS25980 eFuse validates voltage (11V–16.9V) and current (≤7A); TCO F1 provides thermal protection.
3. **Bucks:** Dual LMQ61460AFSQRJRRQ1 5V interleaved buck regulators (U2A/U2B, 180° DRSS phase offset) and TPS75733 3V3_ENIG LDO (U7) start.
4. **Supercap charging:** LTC3350 begins managed soft-charge of the 8-cell supercap bank (50F/5.4V) from 5V_MAIN, current-limited to 0.5A (RICHARGE programmed accordingly).
   Charge duration from fully depleted state: approximately 9 minutes. Once fully charged, the bank provides ≥33.5 seconds of hold-up at the 15W CM5 graceful shutdown load.
5. **Supervisor:** Once 5V_MAIN hits 4.5V, MCP121T-450E asserts PWR_GD HIGH after a 200ms delay.
6. **Release:** CM5 PMIC begins internal 1.8V/3.3V sequencing.
7. **Heartbeat:** MIC1555 starts the 1Hz Orange "Initialising" pulse.

### 3. Graceful Shutdown Sequence

The following sequence ensures the CM5 filesystem is clean and all loads are de-energised safely:

1. **Trigger:** One of two events initiates shutdown:
   * **Automatic (primary power loss):** LTC3350 enters backup mode → `/INTB` (open-drain) asserts LOW →
     MIC1555 U15 (monostable) fires → `PWR_BUT` held LOW for 3 seconds → CM5 PMIC sends power-key event
     to Linux → `systemd-logind` initiates graceful shutdown. This is entirely hardware-driven; no
     firmware polling required.
   * **Manual:** User presses SW2 (tactile `PWR_BUT` button), issues OS shutdown command, or triggers
     via the Safe Shutdown Button interrupt path.
2. **OS Shutdown:** CM5 OS saves state, syncs filesystems, and executes `halt`.
3. **ROTOR_EN_N de-asserted (HIGH):** `ROTOR_EN_N` is de-asserted (driven HIGH or released to R10 pull-up) before halt completes,
   disabling the TPS75733 LDO (active-LOW EN: HIGH = shutdown) → 3V3_ENIG off (CPLDs and rotor stack de-energised).
4. **CM5 PMIC halt:** CM5 internal PMIC drops 1.8V/3.3V rails. Total time from trigger to PMIC halt: ~10–15 seconds.
5. **5V_MAIN sag:** 5V_MAIN begins to fall as CM5 load ceases. LTC3350 holds the rail up via supercap discharge for ≥33.5 seconds.
6. **PWR_GD drop:** Once 5V_MAIN falls below 4.5V, MCP121T-450E deasserts PWR_GD.
7. **Rail collapse:** After CM5 load is gone, 5V_MAIN falls to 0V. LTC3350 stops discharge.
8. **Power source removed:** User removes PoE cable, USB-C adapter, or battery. eFuse input drops to 0V.
9. **System fully off:** All rails at 0V; no residual charge path.

> **Note:** `PWR_BUT` (SW2 and the MIC1555 one-shot) initiates a graceful OS shutdown via the CM5 PMIC
> power-key event. The MCP121T-450E `PWR_GD` pin is supervisor-only — no manual override is connected
> to it. `PWR_GD` remains a rail-health telemetry signal and is not the shutdown trigger.

### 4. eFuse Latch-Off Recovery

TPS25980 latches OFF under the following fault conditions:

* **Overvoltage (OV):** Input > 16.9V (OVLO threshold).
* **Overcurrent (OC):** Output > 7A (ILIM threshold).
* **Thermal (TCO F1):** TCO opens at 72°C board temperature.

> **Recovery procedure:** See `design/Guides/Maintenance_Guide.md` for the Power Module eFuse
> latch-off recovery procedure and service precautions.

## 4. Thermal Budget

Estimated PM-local power dissipation at system peak load:

| Component | Normal Dissipation | Worst Case | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| U1 TPS25980 eFuse | 0.56W | 0.65W (7A) | 3mΩ Ron (typ.) + ~0.5W quiescent |
| U2A + U2B LMQ61460-Q1 (×2) | 5.2W total | 6.7W (15V USB-C, 90% η) | 2.6W per device at 92% η; exposed pads to GND vias |
| U7 TPS75733 LDO | 0.33W (1.85A load) | 0.45W (2.05A load, Vdo≈0.22V) | Vdo≈0.18V at 1.85A; TO-263 (KTT) 5-pin — standard thermal pad and ground vias sufficient |
| U16 PCA9534A | ~0.02W | ~0.05W | PM-local GPIO expander; negligible thermal load |
| U3 LTC3350 | 0.3W | 0.5W | Charge path only (0.5A); low concern |
| **Total** | **~9.2W** | **~13.0W** | PM-local dissipation only |

**Thermal Notes:**

* The LDO (U7 TPS75733) dissipates ≤0.46W worst-case (TO-263 KTT package). Standard thermal pad soldering and local ground vias are sufficient; no large copper pour required.
* The dedicated heat zone (shared with supercap bank area) connects via thermal pad to the metal enclosure, acting as a heatsink for the bottom of the board.

> * **U4 TPS25751DREFR** — Replaces NRND TPS25750. TPS25751 is PD3.1 USB-IF certified (TID#10306); D-variant integrates the full bi-directional 20V/5A power path required to source 5V/5A (25W) to the
> CM5 and prevent OS throttling. Package: WQFN-38 6×4mm (differs from TPS25750 QFN-28 — KiCad symbol and footprint to be created at schematic capture).
> Mouser: `595-TPS25751DREFR`; DigiKey: `296-TPS25751DREFRCT-ND`; JLCPCB: `C30169739`.
> * **U5 STUSB4500LQTR** — JLCPCB C506650 confirmed in stock (L-variant). Both are pin-compatible; non-L variant STUSB4500QTR has slightly higher Iq (~210µA vs 160µA).
> * **U7 TPS75733KTTRG3** — Replaces the previous high-dissipation LDO. Fixed 3.3V output, 3A continuous, TO-263 (KTT) 5-pin 10.16×15.24mm package.
>   **Active-LOW enable:** EN LOW = LDO enabled; EN HIGH = shutdown.
> R10 changed to pull-**up** (10kΩ to 3V3_ENIG) to hold LDO **disabled** (EN HIGH = shutdown) at power-up until CM5 asserts `ROTOR_EN_N` LOW.
> Signal renamed `ROTOR_EN_N` (active-LOW: drive LOW to enable). This ensures the rotor stack is sequenced on only after the CM5 has fully booted.
> Thermal dissipation greatly improved: ~0.33W typical (1.85A, Vdo≈0.18V) vs 3.1W with the previous part — ≥200mm² copper pour requirement removed.

> 579-MCP121T-450ETTDITR) instead. JLCPCB `C625189` confirmed.
> * **U11 MIC1555YM5-TR** — CMOS timer (Microchip). Timing components: R16=10.0kΩ (R_A), R17=715kΩ (R_B), C23=1µF (C_OSC) → 1Hz, ~50% duty cycle via formula f=1.44/((R_A+2R_B)×C). VCC bypass: C33

> * **Q1–Q3 CSD17578Q5A** — N-channel MOSFET for LM74700-Q1 ideal-diode OR-ing. One per power input (PoE, USB-C, Battery).
> Three LM74700-Q1 instances (U6a, U6b, U6c) are required — one IC per MOSFET for correct per-channel ideal-diode gate drive
> (+7V above source via internal charge pump). Confirm U6a/U6b/U6c footprints at schematic capture.
> * **J1/J2/J3 = TE 1123684-7 (PM) mating with Controller 1-1674231-1** — three 10-position 2.5 mm board-to-board dock connectors.
>   The PM uses the blade header half (`1123684-7`); the Controller carries the mating receptacle (`1-1674231-1`).
>   `J1` carries grouped `5V_MAIN` + `3V3_ENIG`, `J2` carries `VIN_POE_12V` + `GND`, and `J3` carries control / telemetry + guarded returns.
>   These are not standard JLC stocked parts; plan on global sourcing, consignment, or post-assembly install.
> * **J5 USB4135-GF-A** — GCT **6-position, right-angle SMT** USB-C receptacle (confirmed via Octopart; JLCPCB C5438410 verified by user).
>   The 6 positions cover VBUS(×2), GND(×2), CC1, CC2 — exactly what STUSB4500 needs for PD negotiation.
>   **Right-angle (R/A) mounting**: connector sits on the board edge with the USB-C port facing outward — correct for the Power Module's panel-mount power input.
>   ⚠️ **Mechanical caveat**: the connector must penetrate the Power Module enclosure rear face and target the global **2.0mm nominal external overhang** rule.
>   Verify protrusion depth vs enclosure wall thickness at prototype stage; a revised connector or local enclosure adjustment may still be required if the selected part cannot meet the target cleanly.
>   Available at DigiKey (2073-USB4135-GF-ACT-ND) and JLCPCB (C5438410). CC1 and CC2 pins connect

>   Sets LTC3350 BACKUP comparator trigger at **4.812V** (V_thr=1.2V, R_TOP=30.1kΩ, R_BOT=10.0kΩ → actual 4.812V).
>   This fires **before** MCP121T deasserts at 4.50V — LTC3350 activates first, immediately restoring 5V_MAIN and keeping
>   PWR_GD stable throughout the hold-up window. Graceful shutdown is triggered via the `/INTB` → MIC1555 U15 → `PWR_BUT`
>   one-shot (FR-PM-07), so PWR_GD deassertion is not used as a shutdown trigger.
>   Use 0.1% tolerance on both R14 and R15 for threshold accuracy.
> * **22µF bulk/bypass caps (`C1–C15`)** — C1–C15 use Samsung

>   (Murata GRM32ER71H226KE15L) was not available from any distributor —
>   22µF at 50V in 1210 does not appear to be a commercial catalogue part.
>   Maximum actual bus voltage on the hardest-stressed positions
>   (C1/C2, C3/C4, C5/C6, C7/C8, C9/C10, C11/C12) is ~16.4V
> (4S battery, 4.1V/cell max per DEC-005), giving 1.5× voltage derating at 25V rating. ⚠️ Note: X7R capacitors exhibit DC bias
> derating; at 16V on a 25V-rated part (~64% of Vrated), single-cap effective capacitance is approximately 50–65% of nominal (≈11–14µF).
> **To recover this derating, the following 22µF nodes are explicitly doubled:**
> C1+C2, C3+C4, C5+C6, C7+C8, C9+C10, and C11+C12.
> Effective capacitance at 16V becomes ≈22–28µF at each doubled node,
> meeting the nominal 22µF design target.
> C16–C19 are a separate buck-output capacitor class:
> **2× 47µF per LMQ61460 buck stage (4 caps total)**, matching the vendor's

>   R_FSET (R24, 86.6kΩ ERJ-3EKF8662V) sets U2A switching frequency. R_SW (R25, 10kΩ) + C_F1 (C40, 100pF) form a 1µs LP filter attenuating SW node ringing before the first Schmitt stage (U13).
>   R_DLY (R26, 82.0kΩ ERJ-2RKF8202X) + C_DLY (C41, 22nF CL10B223KB8WPNC) implement the RC phase delay: τ = 1.804ms → 180° at 400kHz. R_PD (R27, 10kΩ) ensures U2B SYNC pin is pulled low

> * **R1–R2, R4–R13 ERJ-3EKF series** — eFuse programming resistors R1/R2 and general resistors (R4–R13) are Panasonic **1% thick-film** (ERJ-3EKF). The IC UVLO reference tolerance (±1.7%) dominates
> the UVLO accuracy budget; 1% vs 0.1% resistors are indistinguishable in practice. For pull-ups, LED limiters, and charge current set resistors, 1% tolerance is fully adequate.
> * **R3 ERA-3VEB2100V (210Ω, 0.1% Thin-Film)** — R3 is the eFuse ILIM resistor. Unlike R1/R2 (UVLO divider), ILIM accuracy directly sets the overcurrent trip threshold;
