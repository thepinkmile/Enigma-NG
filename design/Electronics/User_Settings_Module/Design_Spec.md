# User Settings Module (V1.0) Design Specification

**Status:** Draft
**Project:** Enigma-NG
**Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot
**Version:** v.0.1.0
**Associated Hardware Revision:** Rev A
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-26

## 1. Overview

The User Settings Module is a panel-mount PCB providing user-accessible hardware configuration controls
for the Enigma-NG system. It replaces the DIP switches previously located on the Stator Board with
10 sub-miniature SPDT toggle switches plus 12 discrete RGB status LEDs, mounted through the right
side of the enclosure top face near the rotors. A momentary active-low `CFG_APPLY_N` pushbutton
captures the user's configuration intent; the CM5 firmware then mirrors that request onto the
Stator-side apply/reset path.

The User Settings Module communicates with the Stator Board exclusively via a 6-wire I²C harness
(J1 → Stator J13), sharing the Stator I²C-1 bus. It hosts three MCP23017 GPIO expanders:

* **U1 (@ 0x23):** Reads the 10 toggle-switch states and the `CFG_APPLY_N` momentary button.
* **U2 (@ 0x24):** Drives Bank 1 LED anodes (1 source-status LED + 4 config LEDs) and RGB bank-rail low-side switches.
* **U3 (@ 0x25):** Drives Bank 2 LED anodes (1 source-status LED + 6 config LEDs) and RGB bank-rail low-side switches.

No JTAG chain is present on this board. All configuration logic is handled by the CM5 enigma
daemon over I²C.

* **Location:** Right side of enclosure top face, near rotors.
* **Mounting:** Panel-mount switches through enclosure panel; PCB mounted behind panel.
* **Stackup:** 4-layer JLC04161H-7628 / 2oz copper.
* **Role:** User-accessible configuration panel; I²C peripheral to Stator Board.

## 2. Core Features

* **10 Panel-Mount Toggle Switches + 12 RGB LEDs:** E-Switch 200 series SPDT toggles provide the
  user-intent configuration inputs; one discrete Kingbright common-anode RGB LED is mounted beside
  each config position, and one additional RGB source-status LED is provided per bank. Bank 1
  therefore has 4 config toggles + 5 LEDs total; Bank 2 has 6 config toggles + 7 LEDs total.
* **Three-Expander Architecture:** U1 reads all switch states, while U2 and U3
  independently drive the two indicator banks. Separate expanders prevent LED drive state from
  interfering with switch read-back and keep the Settings address block contiguous after the Stator.
* **Per-Bank CM5-Active Status:** Each bank has a CM5-owned logical state
  (`CFG_ROUTE_CM5_ACTIVE`, `CFG_REFMAP_CM5_ACTIVE`) reflected by the bank's source-status LED and
  shared colour rail. LOW = the CM5 is forwarding user-intent config. HIGH = the CM5 is applying a
  GUI-selected or automated override.
* **RGB LED Feedback:** Green = switch-defined active; Red = CM5-defined override. Blue remains
  available for CM5-controlled status, boot, or fault states. Per-bit anode control illuminates
  only set bits. Shared per-bank RGB rails simplify wiring (6 low-side sink MOSFETs total).
* **`CFG_APPLY_N` Button:** Momentary pushbutton requests a Stator-only configuration reload via the
  CM5 daemon. CM5 reads the user-intent switch state, writes the final config to U8 on the
  Stator, and pulses the Stator-side `CFG_APPLY_N` output low.
* **I²C-Only Interface:** 6-wire harness to Stator (`3V3_ENIG`, `5V_MAIN`, `GND`, `SDA`, `SCL`, `GND`) — no parallel signal wiring.

### GND_CHASSIS Single-Point Bond

Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5`, the User Settings Module implements a local
`GND_CHASSIS` net tied to its mounting holes and any panel-contact mechanical features, but it does
**not** implement a local GND-to-GND_CHASSIS bond. The system's only galvanic GND ↔ GND_CHASSIS
bond is defined on the Power Module at the common power-entry point immediately before the eFuse.
J1 pin 3 is therefore **logic GND return only**, and must not be repurposed as a local
chassis-bond point.

---

## 3. Configuration Bank Descriptions

### Bank 1 — Plugboard Routing (`CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` + `CFG_ROUTE_CM5_ACTIVE`)

Bank 1 provides a 4-bit user-intent image of the logical `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` bus, selecting the active
routing case from 16 configurations synthesised into the Stator CPLD fabric. `CFG_ROUTE[1:0]`
encode **Plugboard Pass 1** (`J6/J7`) insertion position; `CFG_ROUTE[3:2]` encode **Plugboard Pass
2** (`J8/J9`) insertion position.

The CM5 daemon decides whether the applied `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` value is the forwarded User Settings Module
user-intent image or a CM5-defined override. `CFG_ROUTE_CM5_ACTIVE` is the CM5-owned status state
used to colour the Bank 1 indicators: LOW = user-intent forwarded (green), HIGH = CM5-defined
override active (red).

Pull-down resistors (10kΩ, one per switch signal) hold each input at logic-0 when the
corresponding switch is open. On the Stator, R16–R19 provide the corresponding pull-downs on the
logical `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` CPLD input pins to maintain a safe all-zero default before CM5 initialises
U8.

The final applied `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` value is driven to the Stator CPLD by U8 GPA[3:0] via I²C.
After CM5 writes the final value, it may assert the Stator-side `CFG_APPLY_N` output low to force a
Stator-only configuration reload.

| `CFG_ROUTE` Index (`CFG_ROUTE[3]:CFG_ROUTE[2]:CFG_ROUTE[1]:CFG_ROUTE[0]`) | Plugboard Pass 1 (`J6/J7`) insertion point | Plugboard Pass 2 (`J8/J9`) insertion point | Historical reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 (0000) | None | None | No plugboard — straight through |
| 1 (0001) | Pre-Rotor 1 | None | Single pre-Rotor 1 pass |
| 2 (0010) | At Reflector | None | Later Enigma models (single reflector pass) |
| 3 (0011) | Post-Rotor 1 return | None | Single post-Rotor 1 pass |

| 14 (1110) | At Reflector | Post-Rotor 1 return | — |
| 15 (1111) | Post-Rotor 1 return | Post-Rotor 1 return | Cascaded post-Rotor 1 |

### Bank 2 — Reflector Mapping (`CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` + `CFG_REFMAP_CM5_ACTIVE`)

Bank 2 provides a 6-bit user-intent image of the logical `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` bus used by the Stator
CPLD to select the reflector-map index. The physical Reflector board remains mandatory and always
provides the electrical turnaround at the end of the rotor/extension chain.

The CM5 daemon decides whether the applied `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` value is the forwarded User Settings Module
user-intent image or a CM5-defined override. `CFG_REFMAP_CM5_ACTIVE` is the CM5-owned status state
used to colour the Bank 2 indicators: LOW = user-intent forwarded (green), HIGH = CM5-defined
override active (red).

| Bit | Switch | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` | SW5-SW10 | **6-bit map index** (0–63): selects which involutory map to load from CPLD UFM at configuration load; indices 0–20 are currently allocated |

Pull-down resistors R21–R26 on the Stator CPLD `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` input pins hold each input at
logic-0 when U8 is uninitialised (default map index = 0).

When Bank 2 is latched, the Stator CPLD loads the selected map and applies it at the reflection
boundary while the physical Reflector board remains in the active ENC signal path.

**UFM map storage:** 21 involutory reflector maps (same as defined in Stator/Design_Spec.md §3):

| Index | Map | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | UKW-A equivalent | Historical Enigma Reflector A (26-char; entries 26–63 = identity for 64-char variant) |
| 1 | UKW-B equivalent | Historical Enigma Reflector B — most common WWII Enigma variant |
| 2 | UKW-C equivalent | Historical Enigma Reflector C — later wartime variant |
| 3–20 | Custom | User-defined involutory maps via JTAG programming |

## 5. LED Control Logic

### Colour Scheme

Full RGB capability with software-selectable colors per bank:

| CM5_ACTIVE State | Primary Colour | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LOW (`CFG_*_CM5_ACTIVE` deasserted) | Green (BNKx_G transistor ON) | Configuration source = User Settings Module user intent |
| HIGH (`CFG_*_CM5_ACTIVE` asserted) | Red (BNKx_R transistor ON) | Configuration source = CM5 firmware / GUI override |
| Special modes | Blue (BNKx_B transistor ON) | Future use: status, bootloader, error states |

> Software can select any RGB color by enabling the appropriate color-rail transistor. Only one
> color is active per bank at any time, so the definitive worst-case indicator-rail budget is
> **240mA total**: Bank 1 = 5 LEDs × 20mA = 100mA max, Bank 2 = 7 LEDs × 20mA = 140mA max.
>
### Per-Bit Illumination

* Each bank has one always-on source-status LED anode plus individual config-bit LED anodes
  (U2 drives Bank 1 anodes, U3 drives Bank 2 anodes).
* CM5 daemon sets each anode HIGH to illuminate that bit's LED when the corresponding bit in the
  active configuration is set (= 1) and the correct bank colour rail is enabled.
* Unset bits (= 0) have their anode held LOW (LED off); only active configuration bits are
  illuminated.

### Bank Source-Status LED

The first LED in each bank (`D1` / `D6`) is a source-status indicator rather than a
switch-paired LED. Its anode is driven HIGH whenever the bank is active, while the shared RGB rail
colour communicates whether the applied configuration is user-intent forwarded (green) or
CM5-defined (red).

### Low-Side Colour-Rail Circuit

The six colour-rail sink stages on this board (`BNK1_R/G/B`, `BNK2_R/G/B`) follow the common RGB
sink-stage rule defined in `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3.1`.

On the User Settings Module this pattern is applied as one `BSS138` low-side sink per bank colour rail,
with gates driven by `U2` / `U3`.

Each LED uses three dedicated series resistors: one in each red, green, and blue cathode path.
This allows the three dice to be balanced independently under nominal 5V operation.

When the GPIO output is HIGH, the transistor turns ON, sinking the selected colour rail to GND and
illuminating any LEDs in that bank whose anode outputs are HIGH. GPIO LOW = transistor OFF = colour
rail disabled.

---

## 6. `CFG_APPLY_N` Button

SW11 is a board-mounted momentary tactile switch (SPST, active-low) connected to
U1 GPB[7]. The switch itself does not need to be panel-mount; the enclosure may use a
simple plunger or cap to mechanically actuate the switch through the panel opening.

* **Pull-up:** 10kΩ to 3V3_ENIG (R11) — idle state = logic HIGH.
* **Debounce:** 100nF X7R 0402 capacitor to GND (C4; RC τ = 1ms).
* **Operation:** CM5 enigma daemon polls GPB[7] during its main loop. On detecting LOW (button
  pressed, after debounce), the daemon:
  1. Reads U1 (full 16-bit state).
  2. Determines whether each bank should forward User Settings Module user intent or apply a CM5 override.
  3. Writes final configuration to U8 GPA[3:0] and GPB[5:0] on the Stator Board.
  4. Pulses the Stator-side `CFG_APPLY_N` output (U8 GPA[4]) LOW then HIGH to trigger a
     Stator-only configuration reload.
  5. Updates U2 and U3 outputs to reflect the new configuration source and state.

This button provides operator-initiated explicit configuration commit without relying solely on
automatic polling intervals.

| 6 | GND | LED cathode ground return; high-current return path |

**Connector:** JST B6B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN) — 6-pin JST PH 2.0mm THT
(Mouser: 306-B6B-PH-K-SLFSN, DigiKey: 455-1708-ND, JLCPCB: C131342)

**Cable:** 6-wire harness (100mm recommended); matching JST PHR-6 crimp housing on both ends. Use 28AWG for pins 2 and 6 (power path) and 30AWG for pins 1, 3, 4, 5 (logic/signals).

**Mating connector on Stator:** J13 — same JST PH 2.0mm 6-pin part.

**Why 2× GND pins?**

* Pin 3 (GND): Low-current logic return for MCP23017s (~80mA total)
* Pin 6 (GND): High-current LED return (up to 240mA max, ~120mA typical)
* Separating logic and power grounds reduces noise coupling into I²C signals

## 12. Design Notes

### LED Control Architecture

The User Settings Module uses a **hybrid topology**: shared colour-rail low-side switches for RGB selection
combined with per-anode high-side switches for individual LED illumination control:

* **Colour-rail low-side stage (Q1–Q6):** 6× BSS138 N-channel MOSFETs switch each RGB cathode rail to
  GND — 3 per bank (red, green, blue). MCP23017 GPIO drives gate directly through 1 kΩ resistors
  (R12–R17). GPIO HIGH = transistor ON = colour rail active.

* **Per-anode high-side stage (Q7–Q30):** 12× two-stage circuits (one per LED anode) consisting of:
  1. BSS138 NMOS pre-driver (Q7–Q18) — gate driven by MCP23017 GPIO through 1 kΩ resistor (R54–R65)
  2. PMOS high-side switch (Q19–Q30) — gate held HIGH by 47 kΩ pull-up (R66–R77) to `5V_MAIN`;
     BSS138 drain pulls gate LOW to enable PMOS. PMOS source at `5V_MAIN`, drain to LED anode.

  GPIO HIGH → BSS138 ON → PMOS gate ≈0 V → PMOS ON → LED anode at `5V_MAIN`. Logic is non-inverted;
  no firmware inversion required.

* **Root cause note:** Kingbright WP154A4SEJ3VBDZGW/CA LEDs have typical Vf = 3.3 V (blue/green).
  The MCP23017 GPIO output maximum is 3.3 V and cannot source current into a 5 V-supply anode directly.
  The two-stage high-side topology resolves this without requiring firmware changes or rail compromise.

* **Power-up behaviour:** 100 kΩ pull-down resistors (R81–R98) hold all 18 BSS138 gates LOW during
  MCP23017 Hi-Z at power-up, preventing spurious transistor turn-on and ensuring LED anodes remain
  de-energised until the CM5 drives the expanders.

### 5V Power Routing

Indicator power is provided on `J1` pin 2 as `5V_MAIN` from the Stator `J13` harness.

On the User Settings Module, this rail powers the LED anodes only (240mA max) and is not used by the
logic supply, which remains on `3V3_ENIG`.

### I²C Address Selection

The User Settings Module uses the contiguous `0x23`-`0x25` block immediately after the Stator's
`0x20`-`0x22` expanders. This keeps the shared Settings/Stator GPIO devices grouped together on the
bus. The authoritative full-system I²C allocation is defined in `Controller/Design_Spec.md §4.1`.
