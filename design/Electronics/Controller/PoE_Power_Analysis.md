# Enigma-NG — PoE Front-End Power Analysis: TDK B82806D0060A120 ACF Forward

**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-18
**Status:** Active — TDK B82806D0060A120 selected; see DEC-062
**Affected design document:** `design/Electronics/Controller/Design_Spec.md`
**Prior analysis (Coilcraft / ACF Flyback):** `design/Electronics/Controller/PoE_Power_Analysis_Coilcraft_v2.md`

---

## 1. Background

The Controller Board PoE front-end uses a two-stage architecture:

- **Stage 1 — PD Interface:** TPS2372-4RGWR (IEEE 802.3bt Type 4, 72W class)
- **Stage 2 — DC-DC Converter:** TPS23730RMTR ACF controller driving T1 isolation transformer

The DC-DC stage is designed as an **ACF Forward Converter**. The TPS23730 datasheet uses the label
"ACF Flyback"; TI application literature (e.g. PMP23253) and Google AI analysis confirm the
TPS23730 is equally compatible with an ACF Forward topology. The distinction matters for output
filtering: ACF Forward requires a buck-type output inductor (L1) after the secondary rectifier,
whereas ACF Flyback relies on transformer magnetising inductance for energy storage and does not
use a separate output inductor.

The selected transformer is the **TDK B82806D0060A120**. It is stocked at JLCPCB (C7218686),
DigiKey (495-76653-1-ND), and Mouser (871-B82806D0060A120). See DEC-062 for the selection rationale.

An earlier investigation evaluated the Coilcraft POE600F-12L in ACF Flyback mode; that design
is preserved in `PoE_Power_Analysis_Coilcraft_v2.md` and is deferred pending part availability.

## 3. Duty Cycle Analysis (n = 2)

Formula (ACF Forward): `D = n × Vout / Vin`

Assuming: Vout = 12V, fsw = 200kHz.

| Vin | D (n=2) | TPS23730 window (5–75%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 36V (min) | 66.7% | ✔ |
| 48V (nom) | 50.0% | ✔ |
| 57V (max) | 42.1% | ✔ |

All operating points are well within the TPS23730 duty cycle range.

The previous formula `D = n × (Vout + Vf) / (Vin + n × (Vout + Vf))` was the ACF Flyback formula and is incorrect for this Forward topology.

---

## 4. TPS23730 VCC Derivation (Auxiliary Winding)

Turns ratio Naux:Ns = 1:1, therefore:

```text
V_aux = Vout × (Naux/Ns) = 12.0 × 1.0 = 12.0V
VCC   = V_aux − Vf_aux   = 12.0 − 0.4 = 11.6V
```

TPS23730 VCC operating range: 7–20V. Result: **11.6V ✔**

---

## 5. MOSFET Vds Stress

Formula (ACF Forward steady-state): `Vds_peak = Vin / (1 − D)`

Worst case at minimum Vin where D is highest (Vin = 36V, D = 66.7%):

```text
Vds_peak = 36 / (1 − 0.667) = 36 / 0.333 = 108V
```

MOSFET class required: ≥108V minimum with derating; **200V with standard derating (108 × 1.5 = 162V < 200V) ✔**.
Selected device STD25NF20: Vds = 200V ✔ — no change required.

Note: §6 calculates a separate transient clamp voltage of 118.1V at Vin_max = 57V; this is a transient
condition and does not change the steady-state design requirement above.

The previous formula `Vds_peak = Vin_max + n × (Vout + Vf)` was the ACF Flyback reflected-voltage formula and is incorrect for this Forward topology.

---

## 6. C17 — Active Clamp Capacitor Sizing

C17 sets the ACF clamp voltage. The clamp network recycles transformer leakage inductance energy
(E_Ls) into the Cclamp capacitor each switching cycle. The design target is ΔV_clamp ≤30%
of reflected output voltage.

### 6.1 Peak primary current (worst case: Vin = 36V)

```text
ΔI_Lm = Vin × D / (Lm × fsw) = 36 × 0.667 / (100µH × 200kHz) = 1.200A
I_pk   = Iout/n + ΔI_Lm/2    = 5/2 + 0.600 = 3.100A
```

Lm ±30% worst case (Lm_min = 70µH):

```text
ΔI_Lm_max = 36 × 0.667 / (70µH × 200kHz) = 1.715A
I_pk_max   = 2.5 + 0.858 = 3.358A  (+8.3% vs nominal)
```

Using worst-case Llk = 0.18µH MAX and I_pk = 3.100A (nominal):

```text
E_Ls = ½ × 0.18µH × 3.100² = ½ × 0.18 × 9.61 = 0.865µJ
```

Minimum C17 from resonant energy-recovery formula (DR-CTL-17):

```text
Cclamp_min = Llk × Ipk² / ΔVclamp²
```

Where:

- Llk = 0.18µH (worst-case MAX, TDK B82806D0060A120 datasheet)
- Ipk = 1.375A (TPS23730RMTR current-limit threshold, SLVSER6B §8.3)
- ΔVclamp = Vclamp − Vin_max = 61.14V (transient clamp peak during switch transition) − 57V = 4.14V (10% above Vin_max = 57V)

```text
Cclamp_min = 0.18µH × 1.375² / 4.14² = 0.18 × 1.891 / 17.14 = 0.3403µJ / 17.14 = 19.9nF
```

Next E24 value above 19.9nF: **22nF**. ✔

Voltage headroom check:

```text
Vclamp_peak = Vin_max + ΔVclamp = 57 + 4.14 = 61.14V (transient clamp peak during switch transition)
Vds_peak    = Vin_max + Vclamp_peak = 57 + 61.14 = 118.1V  (< 160V derating limit)
```

Dissipation check:

```text
P_clamp = ½ × Llk × Ipk² × fsw = ½ × 0.18µH × 1.891 × 200kHz = 0.034W  (negligible)
```

Selected: **C17 = 22nF (Kemet C0805C223K2RACAUTO, 22nF X7R 200V 0805)**

A 200V 0805 rating is required: worst-case Vclamp reaches 72V (steady-state SMCJ36CA clamp per DEC-064) and X7R DC bias derating at 100V reduces effective capacitance below the 19.9nF minimum. See DR-CTL-17.

See DR-CTL-17 for the design requirement. See `design/Electronics/Controller/Design_Spec.md` BOM for
supplier PNs.

## 7. Output Filter

### 7.1 L1 — ACF Forward Output Inductor

The ACF Forward topology requires a buck-type inductor on the secondary rail. Lm stores energy
during the primary switch on-time and releases it to the secondary via transformer coupling; L1
provides the second energy storage element in the LC output filter.

L1 specification: 33µH, ≥6A Isat, DCR ≤50mΩ, shielded ferrite, SMT.

```text
ΔIL1 = (Vout × (1−D)) / (L1 × fsw)
      = 12 × (1 − 0.421) / (33µH × 200kHz)
      = 12 × 0.579 / 6.6 = 1.053A (ripple at Vin = 57V, D = 42.1% — worst case)
```

Peak-to-peak ripple: 1.053A / 5A = **21.1% ✔** (target ≤28%).

Selected: **Yageo PA4343.333NLT** (33µH, 6.5A Isat, 48mΩ typ / 58mΩ max DCR, 1265 shielded ferrite).
DCR note: Typ value (48mΩ) is within DR-CTL-22 (≤50mΩ); max value (58mΩ) marginally exceeds the DR.
Accepted at design phase: best available procurable part meeting all other parameters. See DR-CTL-22.

See DR-CTL-22 and `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md` for L1 details.

### 7.2 C20 — Output Capacitor

```text
Cout_min = ΔIL1 / (8 × fsw × Vripple) = 1.053 / (8 × 200kHz × 0.12V) = 1.053 / 192000 = 5.5µF
```

Standard: 100µF / 35V minimum (highly conservative vs 5.5µF minimum; provides margin for DC-bias derating and long-term reliability). Selected: **4× TDK CGA9N1X7R1V476M230KC** (47µF × 4 = 188µF nominal); see DEC-079.

Effective worst-case capacitance (DC bias at 12V + ±20% tolerance + temperature): ≥103µF ✔
ESR: ≤2.5mΩ total at 200kHz ✔. See DR-CTL-19.

---

## 8. Conduction Losses

### 8.1 RMS currents (Vin = 36V, D = 66.7% — worst case for primary RMS)

```text
ΔI_Lm  = 36 × 0.667 / (100µH × 200kHz) = 1.200A

I_pri_RMS = √(Iout²/n² + ΔI_Lm²/12) × √D
           = √(6.25 + 0.120) × √0.667 = 2.524 × 0.817 = 2.062A

I_sec_RMS = Iout × √(1−D) = 5 × √0.333 = 5 × 0.577 = 2.887A
```

### 8.2 Winding losses

| Winding | RMS Current | DCR | P_cu |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary | 2.062A | 35mΩ | 2.062² × 0.035 = 0.149W |
| Secondary | 2.887A | 8mΩ | 2.887² × 0.008 = 0.067W |
| **Total** | | | **0.216W (0.36% of 60W)** |

The low secondary DCR of the TDK B82806D (8mΩ vs 90mΩ for Coilcraft POE600F-12L) significantly reduces winding loss compared to the original Coilcraft design.

---

## 9. Lm Tolerance Impact

TDK Lm tolerance: ±30%. Worst case: Lm_min = 70µH.

```text
ΔI_Lm_max = 36 × 0.667 / (70µH × 200kHz) = 1.715A  (+43% vs nominal 1.200A)
I_pk_max   = 2.5 + 0.858 = 3.358A  (+8.3% vs nominal 3.100A)
```

STD25NF20 pulsed drain current rating: 72A. I_pk_max well within device limits ✔.
Duty cycle variation with ±30% Lm: negligible (Lm appears in ripple only, not in steady-state
duty cycle at fixed Vout). No operating-point issues at Lm extremes.

---

## 10. Clamp Energy

Using Llk_max = 0.18µH and I_pk = 3.100A:

```text
E_Ls    = ½ × 0.18µH × 3.100² = ½ × 0.18 × 9.61 = 0.865µJ
P_clamp = E_Ls × fsw = 0.865µJ × 200kHz = 0.173W
```

Recycled to primary bus by ACF clamp network — not dissipated.
