# Controller Board (V1.0) Design Specification

**Status:** In Review
**Project:** Enigma-NG
**Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot
**Version:** v.0.1.0
**Associated Hardware Revision:** Rev A
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-22

---

## 1. Overview

The Controller Board is a custom carrier board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5), providing the
central processing and supervisory function for the Enigma-NG system. It is the fixed mechanical
motherboard of the enclosure: the removable Power Module and Stator daughtercards both dock into the
Controller, and all enclosure-edge I/O is grouped on the Controller side.

* **Module:** Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5).
* **Role:** Master traffic controller for power, external I/O, and encryption logic.
* **Stackup:** 6-Layer / 2oz Finished Copper per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §2.3.3` (required for 5Gbps differential pair integrity).
* **Shielding:** High-speed signals (Ethernet, USB 3.0, HDMI, USB 2.0) routed as Striplines on L2–L5,
  with GND copper pours on all layers providing inter-layer shielding; L1 and L6 outer layers carry
  SMT components, power fills, and JTAG/silkscreen respectively.
* **RJ45 / PoE:** Ethernet entry, magnetics, ESD, and the PoE front-end are hosted locally on the Controller.
  The PoE front-end delivers its regulated auxiliary output to the Power Module over `J2`.
* **Power from PM:** The Controller receives `5V_MAIN` and `3V3_ENIG` from the Power Module over `J1`.
* **Status LED:** The Controller can override the PM status LED with full-colour control via the I2C connection over `J3`.

### GND_CHASSIS Single-Point Bond

Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5`, the Controller implements a local
`GND_CHASSIS` net tied to its mounting hardware, connector-shield / EMI landing features, and any
other deliberate enclosure-contact points, but it does **not** implement a local
GND-to-GND_CHASSIS bond. The system's only galvanic GND ↔ GND_CHASSIS bond remains on the Power
Module at the common power-entry point immediately before the eFuse, regardless of which input
source is active.

| DR-CTL-10 | OS/firmware configuration | All firmware configuration requirements (including RTC charging disable) are specified in the Linux OS design spec. See `design/Software/Linux_OS/`. | design/Software/Linux_OS/ |
| DR-CTL-11 | DSI1 connector | J9 = Amphenol F52Q-1A7H1-11015, 15-pin 1.0mm pitch right-angle ZIF/FPC connector; DSI1 4-lane: CLK+/-, D0+/-, D1+/-, D2+/-, D3+/- = 10 differential signals; 100 Ω differential impedance; route on L3 (stripline, same as HDMI); capacitive touch I²C may share the existing I²C-1 controller interface when the deferred display add-on is defined | §8 Connectivity; BOM J9 |
| DR-CTL-12 | Actuation Module host dock | J11 = Hirose DF40HC(3.5)-20DS-0.4V(51) receptacle (20-pin, 0.4mm pitch, 3.5mm stacking height); host-side mating connector for AM J1 (DF40C-20DP-0.4V(51)); carries `5V_MAIN`, `3V3_ENIG`, `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N`, and `GND` on a single connector | §8 Connectivity; BOM J11; `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §7.1` |
| DR-CTL-13 | Actuation-request GPIO usage | `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` uses CM5 GPIO 8 as an active-low host control output. The former direct `SERVO_PWM` / `SERVO_HOME` CM5 ownership is retired in favour of the shared Actuation Module architecture. | §6 CM5 GPIO Mapping Matrix |
| DR-CTL-14 | Actuation Module host envelope | The Controller area beneath the installed AM shall be a no-component placement zone except for J11 and four M2.5x3.5mm SMT standoffs (MH5-MH8, 9774035151R) and the copper / vias needed to route J11; standoff placement shall follow the pattern defined in `design/Electronics/Actuation_Module/Design_Spec.md DR-AM-03`; MH5-MH8 positions shall mirror the AM mounting hole pattern; MH5-MH8 pads shall be connected to `GND` (not `GND_CHASSIS`); do not crowd the module with nearby tall parts or enclosure features that would trap heat or block service access. **PCB layout for J11 and MH5-MH8 cannot be finalised until AM schematic capture and PCB layout are complete.** | §8.6; `design/Electronics/Controller/Board_Layout.md` |
| DR-CTL-15 | Power switch Vcc bypass capacitors | U2 (TPS2065CDBVR) and U3 (AP2331W-7) shall each have a dedicated 100nF X7R 50V 0402 bypass capacitor on their Vcc pin, placed within 1mm of the IC per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3.2` | BOM: C13 (U2 bypass), C14 (U3 bypass) |
| DR-CTL-16 | PoE IC bypass capacitors | U7 (TPS2372-4RGWR) and U8 (TPS23730RMTR) shall each have a dedicated 100nF X7R 50V 0402 bypass capacitor on their VCC pin, placed within 1mm of the IC per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3.2`. BOM: C18 (U7 bypass), C19 (U8 bypass) | BOM C18, C19 |
| DR-CTL-17 | ACTUATE_REQUEST_N boot-safe pull-up | R4 (10kΩ 0603) shall connect `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` (CM5 GPIO 8) to `3V3_ENIG` as a pull-up resistor. This holds the active-low line HIGH (no-actuation state) before CM5 firmware configures GPIO 8 as an output, preventing a spurious actuation pulse to the Actuation Module during CM5 early boot. R4 is distinct from R1–R3, which are series protection resistors on GPIO input lines. | BOM R4; §7 Protection & EMI |
| DR-CTL-18 | PoE ACF primary-side clamp capacitor | C17 (22nF X7R 200V 0805) shall be placed in the U8 (TPS23730RMTR) primary-side active-clamp circuit as the Cclamp energy-storage capacitor. A 200V voltage rating is specified: worst-case Vclamp = Vin×D/(1−D) = 36×0.667/0.333 = 72V; at 72V/100V = 72% of a 100V-rated part, X7R DC bias derating reduces effective capacitance to approximately 15–18nF, well below the 19.9nF minimum. A 200V part at 72V/200V = 36% of rating derates by only ~5%, giving effective capacitance ≈21nF. Package is 0805 minimum to achieve 22nF at 200V in X7R. Value derived from Cclamp_min = Llk × Ipk² / ΔVclamp_max²: at Vin=57V, Llk=0.18µH (TDK B82806D0060A120), Ipk≈1.375A, ΔVclamp=10% of Vclamp≈41.4V → Cclamp_min≈19.9nF; standard 22nF selected. Selected: Kemet C0805C223K2RACAUTO. See DEC-062, DEC-064 and `design/Electronics/Controller/PoE_Power_Analysis.md`. | BOM C17; §7.1 PoE Front-End Passive Components |
| DR-CTL-19 | JM dock connector | J12 = Hirose DF40HC(3.5)-20DS-0.4V(51) 20-pin 0.4mm pitch BtB receptacle (3.5mm stack height) for the JTAG Module (JM) dock. Mates with JM J1 DF40C-20DP-0.4V(51). Placement and board location finalised at PCB layout time. | §8.3; BOM J12; `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §7.1` |
| DR-CTL-20 | JM dock no-component zone | The Controller area beneath the installed JM shall be a no-component placement zone except for J12 and four M2.5×3.5mm SMT standoffs (MH9–MH12, 9774035151R) and the copper / vias needed to route J12; MH9–MH12 pads shall be connected to `GND` (not `GND_CHASSIS`); standoff placement shall mirror the JM MH1–MH4 pattern per `design/Electronics/JTAG_Module/Design_Spec.md §4` and `design/Electronics/JTAG_Module/Board_Layout.md §8`. See DEC-057 (standoff ownership), DEC-058 (JM BtB upgrade). **PCB layout for J12 and MH9–MH12 cannot be finalised until JM schematic capture and PCB layout are complete.** | §8.3; `design/Electronics/Controller/Board_Layout.md` |
| DR-CTL-21 | Chassis mounting holes | MH1–MH4 shall be M3 PTH (Ø3.2 mm drill) mounting holes bonded to `GND_CHASSIS` per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §4`. Placement follows GRS §4.3 Pattern A (rectangular board): MH1 bottom-left, MH2 bottom-right, MH3 top-right, MH4 top-left — all at 7 mm inset from both nearest edges. No purchasable BOM entry — plain chassis mounting holes; no components to fit. Exact XY positions TBD at PCB layout. | `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §4.3`; `design/Electronics/Controller/Board_Layout.md` |
| DR-CTL-22 | PoE output filter capacitor | C20 shall be 4× TDK CGA9N1X7R1V476M230KC (47µF 35V X7R 2220 MLCC, AEC-Q200) placed in parallel on the `VIN_POE_12V` rail at the ACF Forward secondary output LC filter (with L1, DR-CTL-25). Value derived from ACF Forward output ripple formula: Cout_min = ΔiL / (8 × fsw × Vripple), where ΔiL is set by L1. At L1=33µH, Vin=57V (D=0.42), ΔiL≈1.05A, Vripple=120mV: Cout_min ≈ 5.5µF. 4× 47µF in parallel = 188µF nominal; with DC bias derating (~10% at 12V / 35V rated) and ±20% tolerance, worst-case effective capacitance ≥103µF — well above the minimum. ESR ≤2.5mΩ total (4 chips in parallel at 200kHz switching frequency). No electrolytics or tantalum — ceramic X7R only per project certification standard. See `.copilot/discussions/ctl-t1-poe-transformer-investigation.md`. | BOM: C20; §7.1 |
| DR-CTL-23 | PoE ACF primary switch MOSFET | Q1 shall be a 150V N-channel MOSFET, ≥5A continuous drain current, ≤20nC total gate charge (Qg), SMT package. Q1 is driven by the TPS23730RMTR GATE_P pin as the primary switch in the ACF Forward topology. 150V minimum Vds is required by: Vds_peak ≈ Vin / (1-D); at worst-case Vin=36V (D=0.667): Vds_peak ≈ 108V; 200V rated part recommended. Selected: STMicroelectronics STD25NF20 — 200V Vds, 18A Id, 125mΩ Rds(on) max, DPAK (TO-252), AEC-Q101. Qg = 28nC at formal test conditions (160V/20A); estimated ~15nC at actual ACF operating conditions under ZVS at Vin≈57V. | BOM: Q1; §7.1 |
| DR-CTL-24 | PoE ACF clamp switch MOSFET | Q2 shall be a 150V N-channel MOSFET, ≥5A continuous drain current, ≤20nC total gate charge (Qg), SMT package — same specification as Q1 (DR-CTL-23). Q2 is driven by the TPS23730RMTR GATE_C pin as the active clamp switch in the ACF Forward topology. Same MPN as Q1 is acceptable. Selected: STMicroelectronics STD25NF20 — same MPN as Q1. | BOM: Q2; §7.1 |
| DR-CTL-25 | PoE ACF Forward output inductor | L1 shall be a 33µH shielded ferrite SMT power inductor, ≥6A saturation current (7A preferred), DCR ≤50mΩ nominal; procurement-constrained exception accepted for Yageo PA4343.333NLT (48mΩ typ / 58mΩ max — typ compliant; max exceeds limit as accepted exception per DEC-063), rated for 200kHz operation. No iron-powder cores. L1 is required by the ACF Forward topology: energy is transferred to the secondary during switch ON time, requiring a buck-style LC output filter to smooth the secondary waveform (L1 + C20 on `VIN_POE_12V`). Value derived from L = Vout × (1-D) / (ΔiL × fsw); at worst-case Vin=57V (D=0.42) and ΔiL=30%×Iout=1.5A: L_min=23.2µH; 33µH selected (next standard value) for ≥28% ripple margin at all operating points. Selected: Yageo PA4343.333NLT — 33µH ±20%, Isat=11A @30% inductance drop, DCR typ 48mΩ / max 58mΩ, Irms 8A, 13.5×12.5×6.2mm, shielded ferrite SMT, AEC-Q200. DigiKey: 553-3457-1-ND; Mouser: 673-PA4343.333NLT; JLCPCB: C2453886. Note: DCR specification is ≤50mΩ; the selected part meets this at typical (48mΩ) but the manufacturer maximum (58mΩ) slightly exceeds the limit — accepted as a procurement-constrained exception; this is the best available option at current procurement time. See DEC-063 and `.copilot/discussions/ctl-t1-poe-transformer-investigation.md`. | BOM: L1; §7.1 |

## 2. Dock Interfaces

The Controller is the fixed motherboard of the enclosure and carries both removable-board docks.

### 2.1. Controller ↔ Power Module Dock

The Controller connects to the Power Module through the `J1` / `J2` / `J3` TE dock set.
See §8.1 for the connector family, link allocations, reference PDFs, and the `J2`
current-sharing rationale.

### 2.2. Controller ↔ Stator Dock

The Controller connects to the Stator through the `J4` / `J5` Molex hybrid dock pair.
See §8.2 for the connector family, link allocations, reference PDFs, and the `J5`
logic-domain grouping rationale.

### 2.3. CM5 Module Under-Body Placement Envelope

The area directly beneath the mounted CM5 module (55mm x 40mm footprint) shall observe a
**height-limited placement envelope** rather than a total component keep-out:

* Low-profile **passive components only** may be placed within the CM5 shadow area.
* Maximum installed component height beneath the CM5: **2.0mm** above the Controller PCB surface.
* Active components, connectors, test points, tall features, and exposed via pads are prohibited within
  this area.
* Copper fills, signal routing, and power planes are permitted beneath the module.
* The mechanical envelope beneath the CM5 remains **2.5mm** using Amphenol `10164227-1004A1RLF`
  (4.0mm stack height). The 2.0mm component-height rule preserves ~0.5mm assembly margin within that
  official clearance.
* The CM5 footprint shadow should still be shown in KiCad on `User.Courtyard`, but as a placement
  reference boundary for the height rule rather than as a hard no-component keep-out.
* **CM5 mounting standoffs:** MH13–MH16 = four `9774040151R` (Wurth Elektronik M2.5×4.0mm SMT
  standoffs) set the 4.0mm stack height for the Amphenol CM5 carrier sockets (J13–J14). Pads are connected
  to `GND` — **not** `GND_CHASSIS`. See `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md` for module
  mounting hole grounding rules.

### 2.4. Physical Connector Placement

1. **Top Edge:** Order from Left to Right
    * **Stator Dock:** `J4` + `J5` Molex hybrid connectors to the removable Stator daughterboard.
    * **PM Dock:** `J1` + `J2` + `J3` TE 10-position connectors to the removable Power Module.
2. **Right Edge:** Order from Top to Bottom to follow CM5 pinout flow:
    * **RJ45 / PoE Entry:** Long-body magnetics jack. The PoE front-end is local to the Controller.
    * **USB 3.0:** Dual-Stacked Type-A (Molex 48406-0003).
    * **HDMI:** Full-Size Type-A (TE 2007435-1).

**Right-edge support circuitry note:** The USB and HDMI current-limit switches, the edge-I/O ESD
protection network, and the `USB_FAULT_N` telemetry path are all local support circuitry for these
interfaces, but they are not enclosure-protruding connectors and do not define the external connector
order.

**External-face note:** Controller right-edge external connectors follow the global **2.0mm nominal
overhang** rule defined in `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §4.1`.

## 3. JTAG Programming Subsystem (USB Blaster)

The Controller provides JTAG pass-through only. All JTAG chain architecture, device ordering, buffering, termination, and timing specifications are defined in the JM Design_Spec.

* **Controller Pass-Through:** JTAG lines (TCK, TMS, TDI, TTD_RETURN) are routed directly
  from the JM BtB connector (`J12`) to the Stator logic dock (`J5`) on the Controller board without any active
  components. No buffer or series resistors reside on the Controller for JTAG signals.
* **Cross-ref:** See `design/Electronics/JTAG_Module/Design_Spec.md` for all JTAG chain architecture, FT232H module schematics, buffering, and assembly details. See DEC-016, DEC-024.

## 4. Telemetry & Logic (INA219 + SMBus)

Current monitoring for both rails is managed via the I2C-1 bus (CM5 GPIO 2/3) and is
implemented on the respective boards - not on the Controller:

* **INA219 U10 (0x40) - 5V_MAIN monitor:** Power Module. See `design/Electronics/Power_Module/Design_Spec.md §3 Telemetry`.
* **INA219 U2 (0x45) - Rotor-stack monitor:** Stator board. See `design/Electronics/Stator/Design_Spec.md §5. Power Telemetry`.

For DT bindings and driver configuration for both INA219 devices, see
`design/Software/Linux_OS/Power_Management.md §INA219 Rotor Stack Current Monitor`.

### 4.1. I²C Bus Topology

All I²C devices share the single I²C-1 bus (CM5 GPIO 2/3) routed to the Power Module over `J3` and to
the Stator over `J5`.

| Address | Device | Location | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x09 | LTC3350 | Power Module | Supercap charger/monitor |
| 0x0B | Smart Battery | Power Module | SMBus battery monitoring |

| 0x21 | MCP23017 (U7) | Stator | Virtual keypress injection, SOURCE_SEL, CPLD_RESET_N, spare GPIO |
| 0x22 | MCP23017 (U8) | Stator | CPLD config output driver (DEC-032) |
| 0x23 | MCP23017 (U1) | User Settings Module | Switch input reader (DEC-032) |

| 0x28 | STUSB4500 | Power Module | USB-C PD controller |
| 0x3F | PCA9534A (U14) | Power Module | PM-local status inputs + SW1 RGB handoff control |
| 0x40 | INA219 (U10) | Power Module | 5V_MAIN current/power telemetry |
| 0x45 | INA219 (U2) | Stator | Rotor stack current/power telemetry |

> **MCP23017 configuration cross-reference:** Full GPIO pin assignments, port-function tables, and
> address-selection wiring for U6 (0x20), U7 (0x21), and U8 (0x22) are defined in
> `design/Electronics/Stator/Design_Spec.md §3` and the Stator BOM. This table lists I²C addresses
> and high-level functions only.

> **TPS25751 (PM U4) is intentionally absent from this I²C address map.** The TPS25751 is operated in
> fixed passive PD emulator mode with its USB-C PDO profile stored in internal NVM. No I²C connection to
> U4 is required or used in this design. See PM `Design_Spec.md §5` and DEC-012.

## 5. RTC Backup Battery

The CM5's MXL7704 PMIC contains an integrated RTC. To maintain timekeeping through power cycles,
a 3V coin cell is required on the CM5's VBAT pin (**Pin 76** on the CM5 Hirose DF40 200-pin connector).

### 5.1. Circuit Design

* **Battery (BT1):** Keystone 3034TR CR2032 SMD horizontal retainer (`TR` = tape-reel packaging). CR2032 = 3.0V, 220mAh.
  Estimated service life >25 years at <1µA RTC quiescent draw.
* **Protection Diode (D1):** BAT54 Schottky diode (SOT-23, 30V, 200mA).
  Connected in series: BT1(+) → D1(anode), D1(cathode) → CM5 VBAT (Pin 76). Vf ≈ 0.3V @ 100µA; delivers
  ~2.7V to VBAT pin (within MXL7704 VBAT operating range). **This diode is mandatory with a CR2032 -
  it physically prevents the PMIC charging circuit from reaching the battery.**
* **Bypass Cap (C6):** 100nF X7R 0402 (Samsung CL05B104KB5NNNC) from VBAT to GND, placed within 5mm
  of the CM5 DF40 connector Pin 76.

> ⚠️ **Do NOT substitute ML2032 for CR2032 without removing D1.** The ML2032 is rechargeable and
> must connect directly to VBAT (no diode). The software charging-disable note in
> `design/Software/Linux_OS/Power_Management.md` also applies.
>
### 5.2. Placement

* **BT1:** Left edge of board, minimum 20mm from any high-speed trace (GbE pairs, USB 3.0, HDMI).
  Orient so the battery ejects away from the board centre for service access.
* **Battery replacement:** Classified as a **service-by-disassembly** task - not field-replaceable in-situ.

## 6. CM5 GPIO Mapping Matrix (Enigma-NG)

All GPIOs are referenced to **3V3_ENIG**. BCM2712 silicon limit: 50mA aggregate per GPIO bank.

> **CM5 VDD_GPIO_REF:** The CM5 module VDD_GPIO_REF pin on the Hirose DF40 200-pin module connector
> must be connected to **3V3_ENIG** (not to the CM5-internal `CM5 3V3` rail, which is not used as a
> logic reference on this board). This ensures GPIO logic levels match all 3V3_ENIG-powered peripherals
> (CPLDs, FT232H VCCIO, etc.). Failure to connect VDD_GPIO_REF to 3V3_ENIG will result in incorrect
> GPIO logic levels for the entire system.

| GPIO | Function | Type | Logic Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2 / 3** | **I2C_SDA/SCL** | I2C | 3.3V | System I2C-1 shared with the devices listed in §4.1. |
| **4** | **ROTOR_EN_N** | Output | 3.3V | Active-low: drive LOW to enable Power Module `3V3_ENIG` for sequenced rotor-stack power-up; held HIGH by R52 (10kΩ to 3V3_MAIN) pull-up on PM until CM5 asserts. PM provides this pull-up; CTL does not carry a pull-up on this signal — it is an Output-only CM5 GPIO. Routed on `J3`. |
| **5** | **PM_IO_INT_N** | Input | 3.3V | Optional interrupt input from the PM-local `PCA9534A @ 0x3F`, used to wake the power-management daemon for PM status changes. |
| **6** | **USB_FAULT_N** | Input | 3.3V | Active Low: USB power fault from on-board TPS2065C (local to Controller; no BtB pin required). |
| **7** | **PWR_GD** | Input | 3.3V | Direct PM rail-health telemetry only - HIGH while `5V_MAIN` ≥ 4.50V; does NOT trigger shutdown. Routed on `J3`. |
| **8** | **ACTUATE_REQUEST_N** | Output | 3.3V | Active-low request pulse into the Controller-local Actuation Module host dock (`J11`). |

> **GPIO matrix scope note:** `PWR_BUT_N` and `LED_PWR_N` are **not** CM5 GPIO signals and are
> deliberately absent from this table. `PWR_BUT_N` connects directly to the CM5 PMIC dedicated
> hardware power-key input pin (internal 10 kΩ pull-up; brief GND press/LOW pulse initiates orderly shutdown); active-LOW, confirmed by FR-PM-07.
> `LED_PWR_N` is a dedicated CM5 hardware output (pin 95) that drives the PM SW2 green LED circuit
> over J3. Neither signal requires GPIO direction, pull, or interrupt configuration.

### 6.1 CM5 Dedicated Hardware Pin Name Mapping

Where the CM5 exposes dedicated hardware signals (not GPIOs) using a naming convention other than
the Enigma-NG GRS `_N` active-low suffix, the design net is renamed. The original CM5 pin name is
preserved here for traceability (cross-ref: `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §10`).

| CM5 Pin Name | CM5 Pin No. | Signal Type | Design Net Name | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LED_nPWR` | 95 (Hirose DF40 200-pin) | Dedicated hardware output | `LED_PWR_N` | Active-low power-state indicator; CM5 uses `n` prefix rather than `_N` suffix |
| `PWR_BUT` | 92 (Hirose DF40 200-pin, bottom) | Dedicated HW power-key input | `PWR_BUT_N` | CM5 datasheet name is `PWR_BUT`; renamed to `PWR_BUT_N` to follow GRS active-low `_N` suffix convention. Active-LOW; brief GND pulse initiates orderly CM5 shutdown; internal 10 kΩ pull-up to 5 V; idle HIGH |

## 7. Protection & EMI

* **External Links:** The CM5-facing status inputs `PM_IO_INT_N`, `USB_FAULT_N`, and `PWR_GD` each include
  a 10kΩ series resistor to limit transient current into the GPIO bank. These are R1 (`PM_IO_INT_N`),
  R2 (`USB_FAULT_N`), and R3 (`PWR_GD`).
* **ACTUATE_REQUEST_N Boot-Safe Pull-Up:** R4 (10kΩ) ties `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` (CM5 GPIO 8) to
  `3V3_ENIG`, holding the active-low line HIGH (inactive / no-actuation state) while CM5 GPIO 8 is
  unconfigured during early boot, preventing a spurious request pulse to the Actuation Module. R4
  serves a pull-up function and is distinct from the series-protection role of R1–R3. See DR-CTL-17.
* **Voltage:** 5V signals are strictly forbidden on: CM5 GPIO pins, I²C SDA/SCL lines, JTAG (TDI/TDO/TCK/TMS), and all low-speed PM / Stator dock signals.
* **ESD Protection:** [TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1](https://www.ti.com) (AEC-Q100 automotive-qualified TVS array;
  5.5V DC working voltage; 6.4–8.7V breakdown voltage; 10V clamping voltage (V_CLAMP at 1A TLP pulse,
  I/O to GND); ±12kV contact discharge / ±15kV air-gap discharge, IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4; 0.5 pF per
  channel; USON-10 package) on Layer 1:
  * **U4:** USB-A interface + HDMI interface ESD protection arrays (4-channel device covers both
    connector clusters).
  * **U5:** Gigabit Ethernet differential pairs A+B ESD protection.
  * **U6:** Gigabit Ethernet differential pairs C+D ESD protection.
  * U5 and U6 together protect all four GbE differential pairs. All three devices are placed on
    Layer 1 at the connector entry to minimise stub length, per
    `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md`. The same TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 (USON-10) is used on the
    Stator at U9–U12 per `design/Electronics/Stator/Design_Spec.md §8`.
* **5V_MAIN Bulk Entry:** 5x 10µF X7R 25V at the `J1` `5V_MAIN` entry region per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3` Bulk Entry Bank Rule.
* **3V3_ENIG Tap Decoupling:** The `J1` `3V3_ENIG` entry on the Controller shall follow the
  global bulk-entry bank rule: **5x 10uF X7R 25V** placed at the tap node in a
  **symmetrical star/spoke pattern** per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3`.
  This applies because `3V3_ENIG` is the Controller's canonical logic rail; the
  CM5-local `CM5 3V3` rail is not used as the board logic reference.

### 7.1. PoE Front-End Passive Components

The PoE front-end (U7 TPS2372-4RGWR, U8 TPS23730RMTR, T1 TDK B82806D0060A120) requires application-circuit
support capacitors in addition to the per-IC VCC bypass capacitors specified in DR-CTL-16 (C18 for U7,
C19 for U8).

* **C17 (22nF X7R 200V 0805) — ACF Clamp Capacitor (Cclamp):** Placed in the U8 (TPS23730RMTR)
  primary-side active-clamp circuit. In ACF operating mode (selected by DEC-019), Cclamp stores and
  recycles transformer leakage inductance energy each switching cycle. A 200V 0805 rating is required:
  worst-case Vclamp reaches 72V and X7R DC bias derating at 100V reduces effective capacitance below the
  19.9nF minimum — see DR-CTL-18. Value 22nF derived from TDK B82806D0060A120 leakage inductance
  (Llk=0.18µH); see DR-CTL-18 and `design/Electronics/Controller/PoE_Power_Analysis.md`.
* **C12, C15, C16 (100nF X7R 50V 0402) — PoE Application Circuit Support Capacitors:** Three additional
  local decoupling and application-circuit filter capacitors within the U7/U8 PoE subsystem, distinct
  from the per-IC VCC bypass capacitors C18 (U7) and C19 (U8) specified in DR-CTL-16. C12 decouples
  the secondary output on `VIN_POE_12V`; C15 decouples the VAUX auxiliary supply output (U7,
  TPS2372-4); C16 decouples the VS auxiliary-winding sense input (U8, TPS23730).
* **Q1 (STD25NF20) — ACF Primary Switch:** ACF Forward primary switch driven by TPS23730RMTR GATE_P.
  STMicroelectronics STD25NF20: 200V Vds, 18A Id, 125mΩ Rds(on) max, DPAK (TO-252), AEC-Q101.
  See DR-CTL-23.
* **Q2 (STD25NF20) — ACF Clamp Switch:** ACF Forward active clamp switch driven by TPS23730RMTR GATE_C.
  Same MPN as Q1 (STD25NF20). See DR-CTL-24.
* **L1 (Yageo PA4343.333NLT, 33µH shielded ferrite inductor) — ACF Forward Output Inductor:** Buck-style output
  inductor on `VIN_POE_12V`, forming the LC filter together with C20. Required by the ACF Forward
  topology; not present in flyback designs. Value 33µH selected for ≤28% peak-to-peak current ripple
  at all Vin/Iout operating points (200kHz, 12V/5A, Vin=36–57V). Specification: ≥6A Isat, DCR 48mΩ typ / 58mΩ max (procurement-constrained exception — best available; typ compliant with DR-CTL-25 ≤50mΩ, max accepted),
  shielded ferrite core. See DR-CTL-25, DEC-063.
* **C20 (4× TDK CGA9N1X7R1V476M230KC, 47µF 35V X7R 2220) — PoE Output Filter:** 4× in parallel on `VIN_POE_12V`
  rail. Forms the LC output filter together with L1 (ACF Forward topology). 188µF nominal, ≥103µF
  effective worst-case (DC bias + tolerance + temperature). ESR ≤2.5mΩ total at 200kHz. See DR-CTL-22.

## 8. Connectivity

### 8.1. Controller ↔ Power Module Dock

The Power Module dock uses three copies of the TE 10-position 2.5 mm connector family:

* **Controller side:** `1-1674231-1`
* **Power Module side:** `1123684-7`

**Reference datasheets:** [`TE-1-1674231-1-datasheet.md`](design/Datasheets/TE-1-1674231-1-datasheet.md),
[`TE-1123684-7-datasheet.md`](design/Datasheets/TE-1123684-7-datasheet.md)

| Link | Allocation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `J1` | `3 x 5V_MAIN`, `2 x 3V3_ENIG`, `5 x GND` | Main regulated rails from PM to Controller |
| `J2` | `3 x VIN_POE_12V`, `7 x GND` | Regulated PoE-derived auxiliary feed from Controller PoE front-end into PM OR-ing stage |
| `J3` | `I2C_SDA`, `I2C_SCL`, `PM_IO_INT_N`, `PWR_GD`, `ROTOR_EN_N`, `PWR_BUT_N`, `LED_PWR_N`, `3 x GND` | Low-speed control / telemetry connector |

`5V_MAIN` and `3V3_ENIG` both enter the Controller on `J1`. The Controller then distributes those rails
to the CM5, local peripherals, and the Stator docks.

`J2` intentionally uses only three positive `VIN_POE_12V` contacts because the TE dock family is rated
at 6 A/contact and the regulated PoE auxiliary feed is a 60 W / 12 V class source (~5 A worst case).
The positive side is therefore already heavily overprovisioned, while the additional ground contacts
reduce return impedance and spread the shared current path into the PM OR-ing stage.

### 8.2. Controller ↔ Stator Dock

The Stator dock uses the Molex EXTreme Guardian HD hybrid pair:

* **Controller side:** `2195630015` receptacle
* **Stator side:** `2195620015` plug

**Reference datasheets:** [`Molex-2195630015-datasheet.md`](design/Datasheets/Molex-2195630015-datasheet.md),
[`Molex-2195630015-drawings.md`](design/Datasheets/Molex-2195630015-drawings.md),
[`Molex-2195620015-datasheet.md`](design/Datasheets/Molex-2195620015-datasheet.md),
[`Molex-2195620015-drawings.md`](design/Datasheets/Molex-2195620015-drawings.md),
[`Molex-ExtremeGuardianHD-2141130000-PS-000-specification.md`](design/Datasheets/Molex-ExtremeGuardianHD-2141130000-PS-000-specification.md)

| Link | Allocation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `J4` | `4 x 5V_MAIN` blades, `1 x GND` blade, signal field = `GND` returns / guards | 5V-biased dock |
| `J5` | `4 x 3V3_ENIG` blades, `1 x GND` blade, guarded `TCK`, `TMS`, `TDI`, `TTD_RETURN`, `I2C_SDA`, `I2C_SCL`, remaining signal contacts = `GND` | 3V3 / logic dock |

The `J5` connector deliberately groups the JTAG cluster and `TTD_RETURN` with the logic-domain `3V3_ENIG` feed.

### 8.3. JM BtB Dock (J12)

The JTAG Module mounts on the Controller via a single Hirose DF40HC(3.5)-20DS-0.4V(51)
20-pin board-to-board receptacle (J12) with 3.5mm stack height, plus four M2.5×3.5mm SMT
standoffs (MH9–MH12, 9774035151R; pads to `GND`, not `GND_CHASSIS` — see
`design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md` for module mounting hole grounding rules). The JM J1 plug mates with J12 at bottom-centre of the JM,
with R1 (outer edge row) oriented toward the LINK-BETA connector (J4/J5) to minimise JTAG trace lengths.
See DR-CTL-19, DR-CTL-20, DEC-057, DEC-058.

* **Part:** Hirose DF40HC(3.5)-20DS-0.4V(51) — 3.5mm stack-height BtB receptacle, 20-pin, 0.4mm pitch.
* **DigiKey:** 26-DF40HC(3.5)-20DS-0.4V(51)CT-ND | **Mouser:** 798-DF40HC3520DS04V5 | **JLCPCB:** C3644774
* **Mating Part (JM J1):** Hirose DF40C-20DP-0.4V(51) — plug on JM. See `design/Electronics/JTAG_Module/Design_Spec.md §3`.
* **Polarity enforcement:** The DF40 connector body is polarity-free (Note 4 in Hirose datasheet);
  asymmetric placement of MH9–MH12 standoffs (per `design/Electronics/JTAG_Module/Design_Spec.md DR-JM-18`) is mandatory to
  enforce a single valid mating orientation. A silkscreen pin-1 marker is required on both boards
  (per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §7.1`).

### 8.4. Fan Connector (J10)

* **Part:** JST SM04B-SRSS-TB(LF)(SN) - 4-pin JST SH 1.0mm pitch right-angle header
* **Mating Part:** JST SHR-04V-S (female crimp housing)
* **JLCPCB:** C160404 | **Mouser:** 306-SM04BSRSSTBLFSN | **DigiKey:** 455-SM04B-SRSS-TBCT-ND
* **Pinout:**

| Pin | Signal | Source |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | 5V_MAIN | Controller 5V_MAIN rail |
| 2 | GND | Controller GND |
| 3 | FAN_TACH | CM5 module connector Pin 16 |
| 4 | FAN_PWM | CM5 module connector Pin 19 |

* FAN_TACH and FAN_PWM connect directly from the CM5 module DF40 connector (dedicated BCM2712 fan controller interface). No GPIO allocation required.
* Mating fan cable: JST SHR-04V-S housing with 4x JST SSH-003T-P0.2 crimp terminals.

### 8.5. DSI1 Display Connector (J9)

* **DSI1 Display (J9):** Amphenol **F52Q-1A7H1-11015** 15-pin 1.0mm pitch ZIF/FPC connector.
  Breaks out DSI1
  4-lane interface from CM5 for optional lid-mounted touchscreen add-on. Display add-on board
  design is deferred (see DEC-033). Connector placed near CM5 mezzanine socket on L1.
  Touch I²C routed on I²C-1 bus shared with other Stator/Controller peripherals.
* **Interface:** MIPI DSI1 - 4-lane differential (CLK+/-, D0+/-, D1+/-, D2+/-, D3+/-).
* **Impedance:** 100 Ω differential; route on L3 (stripline) - same rule as HDMI/Ethernet.
* **Pin assignment:** The J9 pin-to-signal assignment (DSI1 CLK±, data lanes D0–D3±, GND, and power
  pins) is defined by the Raspberry Pi CM5 module standard and documented in the
  [Raspberry Pi CM5 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm5/cm5-datasheet.pdf). These
  assignments are not a board design choice and must follow the CM5 DSI1 interface definition
  exactly; any deviation would break CM5 module compatibility.
* **MPN:** Amphenol **F52Q-1A7H1-11015**. See `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md` and
  `design/Datasheets/amphenol_ffc_fpc_100mm_f52q_f52r-datasheet.md`.
* **Power / deferred scope boundary:** `J9` is the only Controller-side display connector fixed in
  the current design scope. No separate display power header is defined on the Controller at this
  stage; any future display power and touch-side auxiliary wiring stays deferred with the display
  add-on definition.

### 8.6. Actuation Module Host Dock (J11)

> **Connector Definition Owner:** `design/Electronics/Actuation_Module/Design_Spec.md §3.1`.
> This board provides the mating receptacle (J11). Full connector pinout is defined and owned by
> the Actuation Module. Net connections from this board to the mounted AM:
>
> | CTL Net | AM Net |
> | --- | --- |
> | `5V_MAIN` | `5V_MAIN` |
> | `3V3_ENIG` | `3V3_ENIG` |
> | `GND` | `GND` |
> | `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` | `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` |
>
> `ACTUATE_REQUEST_N` is sourced from CM5 GPIO 8 as an active-low output pulse. The Actuation Module
> performs local homing, one-shot latching, and servo PWM generation.
> The idle-HIGH bias is provided by the STM32 internal GPIO pull-up on the AM; no external
> pull-up is required on this board. See
> `design/Electronics/Actuation_Module/Design_Spec.md DR-AM-18`.
>
> **Block location:** J11 and MH5-MH8 occupy the **left-front corner** of the Controller board.
> Exact footprint coordinates follow the AM PCB layout as defined in
> `design/Electronics/Actuation_Module/Design_Spec.md DR-AM-03`. MH5-MH8 shall connect to `GND`
> (not `GND_CHASSIS`). A component keep-out zone covering the full AM footprint shadow is mandatory
> beneath the mounted module to ensure stack height clearance for all components.

* **Part:** Hirose DF40HC(3.5)-20DS-0.4V(51) - 20-pin 0.4mm pitch BtB receptacle, 3.5mm stacking
  height.
* **Polarity enforcement:** The DF40 connector body is polarity-free (Note 4 in Hirose datasheet);
  asymmetric placement of MH5-MH8 standoffs (per `design/Electronics/Actuation_Module/Design_Spec.md DR-AM-03`) is mandatory to
  enforce a single valid mating orientation. A silkscreen pin-1 marker is required on both boards
  (per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §7.1`).
* **Standoffs:** MH5-MH8 = four 9774035151R (M2.5x3.5mm SMT) provide mechanical support and set the
  3.5mm board-to-board spacing; pads connected to `GND` (not `GND_CHASSIS`). See
  `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md` for module mounting hole grounding rules.
* **Host-board envelope:** Reserve the AM footprint shadow on the Controller as a no-component zone
  except for J11, MH5-MH8, and the routing / copper needed to feed them.

## 9. PCB Fabrication & Stackup

### 9.1. PCB Fabrication (JLCPCB Specs)

* **Layers:** **6-Layer** per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §2.3.3`.
  JLCPCB Controlled Impedance (CI) service **required** for all production runs: TDR-verified trace widths
  for USB 3.0 SS (100Ω diff stripline), USB 2.0 (100Ω diff stripline), HDMI (100Ω diff stripline),
  Ethernet BI_D (100Ω diff stripline), and DSI1 (100Ω diff stripline, J9 `F52Q-1A7H1-11015`) on inner layers L2–L5.
* **Finish:** **ENIG (Gold)** for all pads.
* **Solder Mask:** **Dark Green** (Vintage Industrial Lacquer aesthetic).
* **Silkscreen:** White, Typewriter-style font, Bilingual (ALL-CAPS GERMAN / Sentence-case English).

### 9.2. Advanced Layer Stackup (6-Layer / 2oz) [GRS §2.3.3]

Physical stackup properties: see `design/Production/JLCPCB_Manufacturing.md §1.2` and `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §2.3.3`.

**Layer signal assignments:**

| Layer | Role | Primary Signals |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1 (Top outer)** | SMT components + GND/power copper fills | Power control GPIOs, I2C, passive components |
| **L2 (Inner signal)** | High-speed stripline group A | USB 3.0 SS Port 1 TX+/TX−/RX+/RX−; Ethernet BI_DB diff pairs |
| **L3 (Inner signal)** | High-speed stripline group B | USB 2.0 D+/D−; HDMI diff pairs; DSI1 primary lanes |
| **L4 (Inner signal)** | High-speed stripline group C | DSI1 continued; secondary high-speed signal routing |
| **L5 (Inner signal)** | High-speed stripline group D | USB 3.0 SS Port 2 TX+/TX−/RX+/RX−; Ethernet BI_DC diff pairs |
| **L6 (Bottom outer)** | GND/power copper fills + silkscreen | JTAG pass-through traces; Data Plate silkscreen |

**Ethernet BI_DB crossover rationale:** The Würth 7499111121A RJ45 connector physically places the BI_DC
pairs (pins 4 & 5) between the BI_DB pairs (pins 3 & 6) on the PCB landing, making a same-layer non-crossing
layout geometrically impossible. The crossover is resolved by assigning BI_DB to L2 and BI_DC to L5, with via
transitions at the connector pads.

**USB 3.0 dual-stack isolation rationale:** The Molex 48406-0003 dual-stack Type-A connector carries two
independent SuperSpeed pairs (Port 1 and Port 2). Routing both on the same layer requires crossovers and
increases crosstalk risk. Port 1 SS is assigned to L2, Port 2 SS to L5, for physical isolation.

**J8 (Molex 48406-0003) THT assembly note:**
The Molex 48406-0003 drawing specifies a 1.2 mm PCB; the CTL board is a 6-layer JLC061621-3313 design with a
finished thickness of ~1.60 mm. Tail protrusion below board: nominal 2.67 − 1.60 = **1.07 mm**; minimum
2.37 − 1.60 = **0.77 mm**. Both exceed the IPC-A-610 minimum protrusion of 0.50 mm; wave solder or
selective solder is feasible on the 1.6 mm CTL board. ✅

**J8 mounting hole routing clearance:**
The two ⌀2.30 mm Molex 48406-0003 mounting holes pass through all layers on the 6-layer CTL board.
No CI signal routing is permitted within ≥0.5 mm of any mounting hole edge on any inner layer.

### 9.3. Trace Widths & Impedance

All controlled-impedance values are JLCPCB-calculator-authoritative for the stackup defined in `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §2.3.3` (non-coplanar).
JLCPCB CI service is **required** for all production runs of the Controller Board.

### 9.4. Via Design Rules

**CM5 Amphenol connector (via-in-pad):**
The CM5 underside connector mates with the Amphenol `10164227-1004A1RLF` 100-pin carrier sockets (J13/J14). Many CM5
signal pads require via-in-pad construction to route high-density 0.4mm-pitch signals to inner layers.
All via-in-pad holes on the CM5 connector footprint shall be:

* **Type VII (IPC-4761):** Resin-filled and capped (epoxy fill + copper cap).
* **Stub resonance:** Via stubs from L1 to L2 in the `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §2.3.3` stackup resonate at approximately
  27 GHz — well above the 5 Gbps USB 3.0 Nyquist (2.5 GHz). Back-drilling is **not required**.
* **Anti-pad:** GND copper pour shall include an anti-pad clearance of drill diameter + 0.2–0.3 mm
  around all CI signal vias to prevent unintended GND shorting.

**ESD TVS placement (Ethernet/PoE++):**
Per DR-CTL-19, two tiers of ESD protection are implemented on the Ethernet/PoE front-end:

* **Power-side (D2):** Bourns `1.5SMBJ36CA` bidirectional TVS (DO-214AA, CA suffix = bidirectional) placed between the primary winding
  of the integrated magnetics in J8 (Würth 7499111121A) and the TPS23730 PD controller (U8). This clamps
  PoE++ overvoltage transients before reaching the PD controller and ACF forward converter.
* **Data-side (U4–U6):** Texas Instruments `TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1` 4-channel ESD arrays placed **line-side** —
  between the RJ45 connector pads and the primary winding of the magnetics — to clamp ESD transients on
  the Ethernet differential pairs before the transformer primary.

## 10. Thermal & Branding

### 10.1. Thermal

Estimated Controller-local power dissipation at system peak load:

| Component | Normal Dissipation | Worst Case | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| U7 TPS2372-4 + U8 TPS23730 + T1 TDK B82806D0060A120 | ~5.1W | ~5.7W | Controller-owned PoE ACF Forward front-end. Loss is dominated by the PoE ACF stage / transformer path at ~51-57W PoE load; see `design/Electronics/Controller/PoE_Power_Analysis.md §3.5`. |
| **Total** | **~5.1W** | **~5.7W** | Fixed Controller-local dissipation only; excludes the CM5 SOM and any optional fan load because those depend on the fitted module SKU and runtime workload. |

* **PM Dock Power Entry:** `J1` carries the grouped regulated rail entry for the Controller. Add a **"Caution: High Current"** silkscreen label adjacent to the PM dock cluster.
* **CM5 Module Thermal Management:**
  * **Heatsink:** Mount the [Raspberry Pi CM5 Cooler](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/cm5-cooler/)
    (SC1144, passive aluminium heatsink, ~41x56x12.7mm, conductive silicone pad) directly onto the CM5 module.
    Fasten with the four corner mounting screws for secure thermal contact.
  * **Active Fan Header (J10):** A 4-pin JST SH (1.0mm pitch) fan connector is provided on the Controller
    board, matching the CM5IO J14 standard. Supports 5V PWM-controlled fans.
    See §8.4 for the connector pinout and mating-cable definition. FAN_TACH and FAN_PWM connect
    directly to the dedicated BCM2712 fan-controller pins on the CM5 module connector - no GPIO
    allocation required.

### 10.2. Aesthetics

* **Silkscreen:** Dark Green mask with White Bilingual Typewriter font. Silkscreen legend must label each pad individually.
* **Branding:** Top-left 10mm "Enigma-NG" shielded gold emblem (Exposed ENIG Gold tied to GND_CHASSIS).
* **Data Plate:** Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §6` on Layer L6, Revision Block text: `LEITWERK [Controller] V1.0`.
