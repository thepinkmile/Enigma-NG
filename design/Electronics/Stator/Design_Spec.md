## 2. Core Features

* **Modular Slots:** 1× Samtec ERF8 female socket set (3 connectors: ERF8-005 JTAG, ERF8-005 Power, ERF8-010 ENC\_DATA) mating with the ERM8 male headers on the Rotor.
* **Power Tree:** A 2oz copper pour for the `3V3_ENIG` rail to handle the **2.05A worst-case typical** load without voltage sag (see `design/Electronics/Power_Budgets.md`).
  The 5A figure previously quoted was a conservative design margin; the LDO hard limit is 3.0A.

### GND_CHASSIS Single-Point Bond

Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §5`, the Stator implements a local `GND_CHASSIS` net
tied to its mounting holes and any deliberate enclosure-contact features, but it does **not**
implement a local GND-to-GND_CHASSIS bond. The system's only galvanic GND ↔ GND_CHASSIS bond is
defined on the Power Module at the common power-entry point immediately before the eFuse, so
`J11/J12` dock-entry GND remains signal/power return only and must not be bridged locally to
chassis on the Stator.

## 3. Encryption & JTAG Hub

* **CPLD:** Intel MAX II EPM570T100I5N CPLD (Logic Router & Reflector).

### CPLD Signal Routing Matrix

The Stator CPLD (U1) is the bidirectional ENC_DATA routing hub for the full encryption cycle.
It has four fixed external ENC_DATA service interfaces:

* `J4` = `KBD_ENC` (keyboard encode source)
* `J5` = `LBD_DEC` (lightboard decode destination)
* `J3` = Rotor 1 ENC connector
* `J10` = Reflector / Extension return connector

It also owns two configurable plugboard passes, each implemented as a paired decode/encode module:

* `J6` + `J7` = Plugboard Pass 1
* `J8` + `J9` = Plugboard Pass 2

The encryption signal passes through the CPLD at three defined interception points:

| Step | CPLD receives from | Optional plugboard insertion | CPLD drives to |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 — Forward entry** | `J4 ENC_IN_KBD[5:0]` — keyboard keystroke | Pre-Rotor 1 position — Pass 1 and/or Pass 2 | `J3 ENC_OUT_ROT[5:0]` → Rotor 1 (starts forward pass through rotor stack) |
| **2 — Reflector return** | `J10 ENC_IN_REF[5:0]` — reflected signal returned from Reflector chain | At Reflector boundary — Pass 1 and/or Pass 2 | `J10 ENC_OUT_REF[5:0]` → Reflector chain → Rotor 30 (starts return pass back through rotor stack) |
| **3 — Final exit** | `J3 ENC_IN_ROT[5:0]` — Rotor 1 return-pass output | Post-Rotor 1 return position — Pass 1 and/or Pass 2 | `J5 ENC_OUT_LBD[5:0]` → Lightboard |

At each step the CPLD either passes the signal transparently (no plugboard) or routes it through
Plugboard Pass 1 (`J6` decode -> passive jackfield -> `J7` encode) and/or Plugboard Pass 2
(`J8` decode -> passive jackfield -> `J9` encode) before forwarding. `J4`-`J9` use Stator-owned
service aliases that map onto the remote Encoder board's generic `ENC_DATA[5:0]` pins. `J3` and
`J10` aliases are Stator-local names only; the downstream Rotor / Extension / Reflector chain keeps
its own generic `ENC_IN[5:0]` and `ENC_OUT[5:0]` definitions. The active insertion positions are
determined by the VHDL routing case statement selected by U8 GPA[3:0] written by the CM5 daemon
(see §3 Panel Switch Configuration and DEC-032).

`ENC_ACTIVE_N` is intentionally **not** part of the wider cipher routing matrix. It is a HID-local
sideband only: the selected keyboard-source activity state is forwarded to `LBD_DEC` so the
lightboard can blank when no key event is active, but the signal is not propagated through the
plugboard, rotor, reflector, or extension interfaces.

#### Configuration Bank 1 — Plugboard Routing

Settings Board toggle switches provide a 4-bit user-intent image of the logical `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]`
bus, selecting the active routing case from 16 configurations synthesised into the CPLD fabric. No
JTAG reprogramming is required to change configuration — only a single JTAG flash at initial
programming. `CFG_ROUTE[1:0]` encode **Plugboard Pass 1** position; `CFG_ROUTE[3:2]` encode
**Plugboard Pass 2** position.

The final applied `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` value is driven to the CPLD by U8 GPA[3:0] via I²C. The
CM5 daemon decides whether that final value is the forwarded Settings Board user-intent image or a
CM5-defined override. `CFG_ROUTE_CM5_ACTIVE` is the corresponding Settings Board indicator state:
LOW = user-intent forwarded, HIGH = CM5-defined override active. Pull-down resistors R16–R19 hold
each CPLD input at logic-0 when U8 is uninitialised (power-up safe default).

| `CFG_ROUTE` Index (`CFG_ROUTE[3]:CFG_ROUTE[2]:CFG_ROUTE[1]:CFG_ROUTE[0]`) | Plugboard Pass 1 (`J6/J7`) insertion point | Plugboard Pass 2 (`J8/J9`) insertion point | Historical reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 (0000) | None | None | No plugboard — straight through |
| 1 (0001) | Pre-Rotor 1 | None | Single pre-Rotor 1 pass |
| 2 (0010) | At Reflector | None | Later Enigma models (single reflector pass) |
| 3 (0011) | Post-Rotor 1 return | None | Single post-Rotor 1 pass |
| 4 (0100) | None | Pre-Rotor 1 | — |
| 5 (0101) | Pre-Rotor 1 | Pre-Rotor 1 | Cascaded pre-Rotor 1 |
| 6 (0110) | At Reflector | Pre-Rotor 1 | — |
| 7 (0111) | Post-Rotor 1 return | Pre-Rotor 1 | — |
| 8 (1000) | None | At Reflector | — |
| 9 (1001) | Pre-Rotor 1 | At Reflector | — |
| 10 (1010) | At Reflector | At Reflector | Cascaded at Reflector |
| 11 (1011) | Post-Rotor 1 return | At Reflector | — |
| 12 (1100) | None | Post-Rotor 1 return | — |
| 13 (1101) | Pre-Rotor 1 | Post-Rotor 1 return | Original Enigma (pre-war) |
| 14 (1110) | At Reflector | Post-Rotor 1 return | — |
| 15 (1111) | Post-Rotor 1 return | Post-Rotor 1 return | Cascaded post-Rotor 1 |

#### Configuration Bank 2 — Reflector Mapping

Settings Board toggle switches provide a 6-bit user-intent image of the logical `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]`
bus used by the Stator CPLD to select the reflector-map index at the reflection boundary. The
physical Reflector board remains mandatory and always provides the electrical turnaround at the end
of the rotor/extension chain; Bank 2 only selects which stored involutory map the Stator applies
before the returned signal re-enters the stack.

The final applied `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` value is driven to the CPLD by U8 GPB[5:0] via I²C. The
CM5 daemon decides whether that final value is the forwarded Settings Board user-intent image or a
CM5-defined override. `CFG_REFMAP_CM5_ACTIVE` is the corresponding Settings Board indicator state:
LOW = user-intent forwarded, HIGH = CM5-defined override active. After writing the final config,
CM5 may assert `CFG_APPLY_N` LOW to force a Stator-only reload.

| Bit | Settings Board toggle | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` | SW_B2[5:0] | **6-bit map index** (0–63): selects which involutory reflector map to load from UFM at configuration load; indices 0–20 are currently allocated |

Pull-down resistors R21–R26 on the Stator CPLD `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` input pins hold each input at
logic-0 when U8 is uninitialised (default map index = 0).

When Bank 2 is latched, the CPLD serially reads the indexed map from UFM into internal flip-flop
registers (~40 µs). At the reflection boundary (Step 2 in the routing matrix), the CPLD applies the
loaded map combinationally while the mandatory Reflector board provides the physical return path on
J10. `ENC_OUT_REF[5:0]` and `ENC_IN_REF[5:0]` therefore remain part of the active signal path in all
supported configurations.

Bank 1 (routing matrix) and Bank 2 (reflector mode) are fully independent; all 16 Bank 1
configurations are valid regardless of the Bank 2 setting.

**UFM map storage:** 21 involutory (self-inverse) reflector maps; same 64-entry × 6-bit format as
Rotor UFM maps (384 bits per map; 21 × 384 = 8,064 bits ≤ 8,192-bit UFM). Maps are involutory by
definition: applying the same map twice returns the original character, preserving Enigma cipher
symmetry. Pre-loaded indices:

| Index | Map | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | UKW-A equivalent | Historical Enigma Reflector A (26-char; entries 26–63 = identity for 64-char variant) |
| 1 | UKW-B equivalent | Historical Enigma Reflector B — most common WWII Enigma variant |
| 2 | UKW-C equivalent | Historical Enigma Reflector C — later wartime variant |
| 3–20 | Custom | Available for user-defined involutory maps via JTAG programming |

* Decoupling and bulk entry capacitor requirements per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §3`.
* **Ferrite Bead Rule:** Use **4x ferrite beads** (one per 3V3_ENIG rotor feed) between the `J12` dock entry and rotor power distribution to isolate switching transients from Controller logic.
* **Current Margin Check:** Rotor rail is budgeted at **1.65A** (30 rotors × 55mA budget — see `design/Electronics/Power_Budgets.md`);
  with 4 parallel feeds this is ~**413mA per bead** nominal sharing,
  well within the **3.5A** bead rating. Total 3V3_ENIG worst case including all CPLDs and encoders: 2.05A (~32% headroom vs 3.0A LDO).
* **JTAG Return:** Includes 10kΩ pull-up on TTD_RETURN at the `J12` logic-dock entry/exit boundary (R2).
* **JTAG Pull Resistors (×4, placed near Stator CPLD U1):**
  * **TMS:** 10kΩ pull-up to 3V3_ENIG (R3) — ensures JTAG TAP resets to Test-Logic-Reset on power-up and when controller is idle.
  * **TDI:** 10kΩ pull-up to 3V3_ENIG (R4) — holds TDI at logic-1 (BYPASS) when not actively driven by the Controller.
  * **TCK:** 10kΩ pull-down to GND (R5) — prevents spurious clocking when TCK line is floating.
  * **SYS_RESET_N:** 10kΩ pull-up to 3V3_ENIG (R6) — active-low signal; pull-up ensures CPLD remains
    out of reset by default.
* **JTAG Trace Width Rule:** All JTAG signal traces on L1 (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO) shall
  be routed at **0.127 mm (5 mil)** width over the L2 GND plane, targeting **50 Ω controlled
  impedance**. See `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md` and DEC-016.
* **JTAG Series Termination at Encoder Port Outputs:** 75 Ω series resistors placed within 2 mm of
  each encoder-port connector pad **on the Stator PCB**, targeting 95 Ω source impedance to match
  the ~100 Ω IDC ribbon cable:
  * **R7-R12:** TCK -> J4, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9 respectively.
  * **R33-R38:** TMS -> J4, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9 respectively.
  * **R27:** Stator CPLD TDO -> J4 TDI.
  * **R28:** J4 TDO return -> J5 TDI.
  * **R29:** J5 TDO return -> J6 TDI.
  * **R30:** J6 TDO return -> J7 TDI.
  * **R31:** J7 TDO return -> J8 TDI.
  * **R32:** J8 TDO return -> J9 TDI.
  * All TDI-chain resistors are **Stator-side** resistors — no series resistors are required at the
    Encoder cable inputs.
* **Reset / Apply path:** `SYS_RESET_N` remains the active-low global reset. `CFG_APPLY_N` is a
  separate active-low Stator-only apply/reset pulse driven by U8 GPA[4]. A dedicated external
  `SN74LVC1G08DBVR` 2-input AND gate combines `SYS_RESET_N` and `CFG_APPLY_N` into the Stator CPLD
  `DEV_CLRN` path so a low on either signal resets the Stator CPLD.

#### External Keyboard Source Mux

The Stator shall use an external 7-channel 2:1 mux implementation at the `J4` keyboard-source entry
point (Step 1 — Forward entry in the routing matrix). `KEY_CM5_ACTIVE` chooses which keyboard-source
bundle is forwarded:

* 6 data lines: physical `KBD_ENC` bus or `CM5_KEY_DATA[5:0]`
* 1 activity line: physical `ENC_ACTIVE_KBD_N` or `CM5_KEY_ACTIVE_N`

The implementation uses `U4` and `U5`, both `74HC157PW-Q100,118` quad 2:1 mux devices, with both
`E` pins tied to GND so the mux path remains enabled whenever the board is powered:

* **`KEY_CM5_ACTIVE=0` (default):** the physical keyboard bundle is forwarded. `ENC_IN_KBD[5:0]`
  enters the cipher pipeline and `ENC_ACTIVE_KBD_N` becomes the selected activity state. Normal
  operator use.
* **`KEY_CM5_ACTIVE=1`:** the CM5 virtual-key bundle is forwarded instead. `CM5_KEY_DATA[5:0]`
  enters the cipher pipeline and `CM5_KEY_ACTIVE_N` becomes the selected activity state, enabling
  CM5 autonomous / virtual-key mode.

The selected activity state is routed to `J5 ENC_ACTIVE_LBD_N` so `LBD_DEC` can blank its outputs
whenever the keyboard source is idle. The same selected activity state is also monitored through U7
for GUI / telemetry visibility.

U7 GPA[7] is used for `SYS_RESET_N` in this implementation, which fully populates the GPA port.
`U7 GPB[0]` is allocated to `CM5_KEY_ACTIVE_N` and `U7 GPB[1]` is allocated to the selected
`KEY_SRC_ACTIVE_N` monitoring input, leaving `U7 GPB[7:2]` spare/reserved. The mux enable function
remains hard-wired active and `KEY_CM5_ACTIVE` continues to occupy GPA[6].

## 4. Interconnects

* **Controller Dock:** The Stator plugs into the Controller through two Molex EXTreme Guardian HD hybrid connectors.
  * **J11 (5V-biased dock):** `4 × 5V_MAIN` blades, `1 × GND` blade, signal field allocated to extra `GND` returns / guards.
  * **J12 (3V3 / logic dock):** `4 × 3V3_ENIG` blades, `1 × GND` blade, guarded `TCK`, `TMS`, `TDI`, `TTD_RETURN`, `I2C1_SDA`, and `I2C1_SCL`; all remaining signal contacts tied to `GND`.
  * **Controller mating part:** Molex `2195630015` receptacle. **Stator plug:** Molex `2195620015`.
  * **Cross-ref:** See `Controller/Design_Spec.md` §2 and `Controller/Board_Layout.md` for the active dock allocation.

* **Settings Board Interconnect:** `J13` is the 6-pin JST PH 2.0mm harness from the Stator to the
  Settings Board `J1` connector.
  * **Signals:** `3V3_ENIG`, `5V_MAIN`, `GND`, `SDA`, `SCL`, `GND`.
  * **Power role:** `5V_MAIN` is fanned out from the incoming `J11` branch to `J13` as a
    pass-through LED supply only.

* **Plugboard Routing — Configurable Signal Chain Positions:**
  The Stator CPLD implements a configurable routing matrix (see §3 CPLD Signal Routing Matrix) with
  three plugboard insertion positions in the full encryption cycle. The active configuration is
  selected via the Settings Board user-intent `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` image, read by CM5
  and driven to the CPLD by U8 GPA[3:0] (16 pre-defined configurations — no JTAG
  reprogramming required for configuration changes). The six encoder ports are arranged as three
  banks of two, with one fixed HID bank and two configurable plugboard-pass banks:

  | Port | Default role | Plugboard signal chain position |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **J4** | `KBD_ENC` | Fixed: keyboard source (not used as a plugboard pass) |
  | **J5** | `LBD_DEC` | Fixed: lightboard destination (not used as a plugboard pass) |
  | **J6 / J7** | Plugboard Pass 1 (`DEC` / `ENC`) | Configurable: pre-Rotor 1 / At Reflector / post-Rotor 1 return (set by SW_B1[1:0]) |
  | **J8 / J9** | Plugboard Pass 2 (`DEC` / `ENC`) | Configurable: pre-Rotor 1 / At Reflector / post-Rotor 1 return (set by SW_B1[3:2]) |

  The Stator CPLD implements all 16 configurations as synthesised VHDL case logic. See
  `design/Electronics/Stator/Board_Layout.md` and `design/Electronics/Encoder/Design_Spec.md §1`
  for further detail.
* **Reflector/Extension Interconnect:** 20-pin (2x10) Vertical Shrouded Header (legacy reflector
  service bus on pins 1-16 plus grouped `5V_MAIN` on pins 17/19 for Extension-local actuation).
  * **Routing:** Cables secured to the chassis floor with conductive EMI tape.
  * Extension boards enable daisy chaining this interconnect (to enable multi-stack rotor configurations).
  * **Cross-ref:** For matching interconnect pinouts on power (3V3_ENIG/GND), SYS_RESET_N,
    `ENC_OUT_REF[5:0]`, `ENC_IN_REF[5:0]`, and JTAG TTD_RETURN lines used for reflector
    loopback/plugboard mapping, See:
    * `Extension/Design_Spec.md`
    * `Reflector/Design_Spec.md`
  * **Reflector boundary aliases (bidirectional — simultaneous):** J10 carries the Stator-owned
    reflector aliases on two separate pin groups simultaneously. `ENC_IN_REF[5:0]` (pins 9–14)
    returns the reflected signal from the Reflector chain to the Stator CPLD (Step 2 receive in the
    routing matrix). `ENC_OUT_REF[5:0]` (pins 3–8) carries the return-pass signal driven by the
    Stator CPLD back to the Reflector chain after optional plugboard insertion (Step 2 drive — starts
    the return pass through the rotor stack).
* **Rotor Interconnect:** The Stator provides 1 rotor slot (Rotor 1 input side) using 3 ERF8 female sockets.
  * **JTAG:** ERF8-005-05.0-S-DV-K-TR (10-pin 2×5, 0.8mm pitch) — TCK, TMS, TTD (TDI function on input side),
    SYS\_RESET\_N with interleaved GND. **J1 pin 6 = TTD** (outgoing TDI to Rotor 1).
    Pin 10 = spare/GND (TDO does NOT return via this connector — it returns via J10 pin 15).
  * **Power:** ERF8-005-05.0-S-DV-K-TR (10-pin 2×5, 0.8mm pitch) — 5× 3V3\_ENIG, 5× GND. Same part as JTAG socket.
  * **ENC DATA (bidirectional):** ERF8-010-05.0-S-DV-K-TR (20-pin 2×10, 0.8mm pitch) —
    `ENC_OUT_ROT[5:0]` (CPLD drives to Rotor 1, forward pass — Step 1 drive);
    `ENC_IN_ROT[5:0]` (CPLD receives from Rotor 1, return pass — Step 3 receive); 8× GND fill.
  * **Cross-ref:** Authoritative pinout is defined in `Rotor/Design_Spec.md §3.4` (DEC-018 ownership).
  * **Note:** Rotor-to-rotor connections beyond Rotor 1 are direct (each Rotor J4/J5/J6 output mates with
    the next Rotor J1/J2/J3 input); Extension boards provide inter-group bridging at group boundaries in
    the serial chain (Stator → Rotor 1 → … → Rotor 30 → Reflector J1–J3).

### 4.2 I²C-1 Bus Devices

The devices listed below are the Stator-local devices on the shared I²C-1 bus. The authoritative
full-system I²C allocation is defined in `Controller/Design_Spec.md §4.1`.

| Address | Device | Ref | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x20 | MCP23017 | U6 | ENC service-bus monitoring (16 GPIO) |
| 0x21 | MCP23017 | U7 | `CM5_KEY_DATA[5:0]`, `KEY_CM5_ACTIVE`, `SYS_RESET_N`, `CM5_KEY_ACTIVE_N`, `KEY_SRC_ACTIVE_N`, spare GPIO (16 GPIO) |
| 0x22 | MCP23017 | U8 | CPLD configuration output driver: `CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` + `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]` + `CFG_APPLY_N` (16 GPIO) (per DEC-032) |
| 0x45 | INA219 | U2 | Rotor stack current/power telemetry |

## 5. Power Telemetry (The "Encryption Load")

* **Purpose:** Provides real-time current/voltage data for the 30-rotor stack to the CM5 GUI.
* **Sensor:** TI INA219 Zero-Drift Power Monitor (Address: 0x45) — dedicated rotor-stack usage telemetry.
* **Placement:** Inserted on L1 (Top Layer) connected to the 3V3_ENIG rail immediately before the rotor stack.
  * Minimum 15mm isolation from Intel MAX II EPM570T100I5N CPLD logic core.
* **Shunt:** CSS2H-2512R-R010ELF (10mΩ ±1% 5A, 2512 Kelvin-sense) rotor-stack shunt resistor. Stator R1 instance. (PM R12 + PM R23 are the first and second system CSS2H; total build qty: 3 — see `Power_Budgets.md`.)
* **Interface:** I2C-1 Telemetry Bus (via `J12`, shared with the Power Module and Settings Board).
* **Filtering:** 0.1µF VCC decoupling (C14) and RC input filter on IN+/IN-: R42 (10Ω RF1, series on IN+), R43 (10Ω RF2, series on IN-),
  C21 (100nF CF, differential across IN+/IN-); f_3dB ≈ 80kHz (differential). Suppresses electromechanical rotor noise at INA219 ADC sampling harmonics.
  See INA219 datasheet Figure 14.
* **Local bypassing:** C14-C20 provide one 100nF local VDD bypass capacitor for each Stator-local IC
  U2-U8; U8 placement remains subject to `Stator/Board_Layout.md §6`.

## 6. EMI & Mechanical

* **Shield Mount:** No local `GND_CHASSIS` landing strip is implemented on the Stator; any internal
  cable clamping or shielding features remain within the signal/power GND domain unless a later
  EMC-focused decision explicitly introduces a justified exception.
* **Clamping:** Dual 3.2mm PTH anchors per cable for Galvanised Steel Bar compression.

---

## 7. PCB Fabrication & Stackup

* **Manufacturer:** JLCPCB
* **Layer count:** 4-layer
* **Stackup:** JLC04161H-7628
* **Board thickness:** 1.6mm
* **Copper weight:** 2oz outer / 0.5oz inner
* **Surface finish:** ENIG
* **Min trace/space:** 0.1mm / 0.1mm
* **Min drill:** 0.2mm

## 8. Thermal & ESD

* **Thermal:** No active cooling required. Low-power passive components only. Relies on chassis airflow.
* **ESD — rotor-facing connectors (TVS required):** J1 (JTAG, ERF8-005) and J3 (ENC, ERF8-010) are exposed to operator handling during live rotor insertion and removal.
  Per DEC-045 and DEC-048, TVS/ESD protection is mandatory on both connector interfaces:
  * **U9** — 1× TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 on J1 (JTAG); channels: TCK, TMS, TTD, SYS_RESET_N.
  * **U10, U11, U12** — 3× TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 on J3 (ENC); 12 channels: ENC_IN[5:0] + ENC_OUT[5:0].
  All arrays shall be placed within 3mm of their respective connector mating edge on L1.
* **ESD — all other connectors (no TVS required):**
  * J2 (Power, ERF8-005): power rail (3V3_ENIG / GND) only — no signal protection required.
  * J4–J9 (Encoder ribbon IDC ports): internal connectors; not accessible during live rotor swap.
  * J10 (Extension Port ribbon, BHR-20-VUA): internal; not accessible during live rotor swap.
  * J11, J12 (Controller dock, Molex 2195620015): blind-mate dock; not operator-accessible under live conditions.
  * J13 (Settings harness, JST PH): internal harness; not accessible during live rotor swap.
  Per `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §9`.
