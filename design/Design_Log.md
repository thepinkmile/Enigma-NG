## DEC-001 — 3V3_ENIG Used Throughout; 3V3_SYSTEM Removed from BtB Interconnect

- **Status:** Obsolete — superseded by DEC-037
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module, Controller Board, Link-Alpha connector

### Decision

The `3V3_SYSTEM` rail (sourced from the CM5 on the Controller Board) is **not** routed to the Power Module over the Link-Alpha BtB connector. All 3.3V logic within the Power Module (RJ45 LED anodes,
I2C pull-ups, BATT_PRES_N pull-up, reset pull-up) is powered by `3V3_ENIG`, generated locally by the Power Module LDO (U7).

### Rationale

- `3V3_SYSTEM` is a CM5-derived rail intended only for external peripheral interfaces (Ethernet, HDMI, USB 3.0 ports). Using it to power internal power-module logic would create a cross-domain

  dependency and complicate sequencing.

- Generating `3V3_ENIG` locally on the Power Module gives a clean, independently-controlled 3.3V supply that is always present when the Power Module is powered, regardless of CM5 boot state.
- Removing `3V3_SYSTEM` from the Link-Alpha connector freed pins 21–24, which were reallocated to extend the 5V_MAIN delivery cluster and GND return path.

### Alternatives Considered

- Route `3V3_SYSTEM` from CM5 over Link-Alpha and use it for RJ45 logic. Rejected: cross-domain dependency, sequencing risk, wasted connector pins.
- Use a second small LDO on the Controller Board to produce a local 3.3V for CM5-adjacent logic. Rejected: unnecessary complexity given `3V3_ENIG` already exists.

### Impact

- Pins 21–22: Reassigned from 3V3_SYSTEM → **5V_MAIN** (supplemental power pins)
- Pins 23–24: Reassigned from 3V3_SYSTEM → **GND** (supplemental return path)
- Combined 5V_MAIN capacity: 18 pins × 0.5A = **9A** (was 16 pins = 8A)
- Legacy Controller probe-access concept Pin 14: Reassigned from 3V3_SYSTEM → **SW_LED_CTRL (GPIO 20)** (subsequently updated; see DEC-009)

## DEC-002 — PoE Option A2 Selected: Coilcraft POE600F-12LD

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module PoE subsystem, T2 transformer, TPS23730 feedback network

### Decision

The PoE transformer T2 uses a **Coilcraft POE600F-12LD** off-the-shelf ACF transformer (12V output, 60W, 200kHz, ≥1500Vrms isolation, SMT package). The remainder of the PoE chain uses TPS2372-4
(802.3bt Type 4 PD interface) and TPS23730 (ACF controller), with TPS23730 feedback resistors adjusted for the 12V output.

### Rationale

- Replaces a custom-wound transformer design (Option A: 15V, 8–16 week lead time, ~£35–46 BOM) with a catalogue part available from Coilcraft Direct.
- Off-the-shelf: **£3.54 qty-1, ~£1.86 volume**, in stock. Lead time: days not weeks.
- Same ACF topology as the custom design — only feedback resistors change. No PCB layout changes to high-current paths.
- 12V output falls within the TPS25980 eFuse UVLO/OVLO window (11V – 16.9V) with no additional buck stage needed.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Option A (Custom T2, 15V):** Higher voltage headroom. Rejected: custom winding, long lead time, cost.
- **Option C (Silvertel Ag59812-LPB integrated module):** Higher integration, 95% efficiency, ~£19–27. Rejected: higher cost, fixed form factor, less flexibility for thermal management, vendor

  lock-in.

- **Kinetic Technologies KPM5912:** 85W, 93% efficiency. Rejected: not stocked by any UK/EU distributor.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Part | Coilcraft POE600F-12LD |
| Output | 12V nominal |
| Power | 60W (Type 4 PD, 72W class) |
| Isolation | ≥1500Vrms |
| Topology | Active Clamp Flyback (ACF) |
| Package | SMT |
| Price (qty-1) | ~£3.54 |

## DEC-003 — PoE Output 12V; OR-ing Priority Logic Required

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module PoE output, OR-ing diode (LM74700-Q1), eFuse input

### Decision

PoE outputs 12V (not 15V) into the OR-ing stage. Because 12V < 15V USB-C input, passive OR-ing would always prefer USB-C and ignore PoE. Active enable logic is implemented: the TPS2372-4 `/PG` signal
drives the LM74700-Q1 gate control low when PoE is live, disabling the USB-C path.

### Rationale

- PoE is the primary field power source when no USB-C adapter is connected. It must not be silently overridden by USB-C passthrough.
- TPS2372-4 `/PG` (power good, active low) is a clean indicator of a live 802.3bt PoE session.
- LM74700-Q1 already provides the USB-C ideal diode function; gating its enable is a minimal-change approach.

### Constraints

- PoE UVLO: 11V. eFuse UVLO: 11V. No margin at UVLO floor — PoE cable must be within 1V drop budget.
- eFuse ILIM utilisation at 12V worst case: 4.67A / 7A = **66.7%** ✓ (within 75% derating target).

---

## DEC-004 — Supercap Charge Current 0.5A Under PoE

- **Status:** Superseded by DEC-029 (cell specification updated; 0.5A charge current constraint retained)
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** LTC3350 supercap charger, PoE power budget

### Decision

When running on PoE (802.3bt Type 4, 72W budget), the supercap charge current is reduced to **0.5A** (vs. up to 2A on USB-C/Battery).
This limits peak PoE utilisation to 73.9% (53.2W / 72W) — within the 75% design rule ✓ (see Certification_Evidence §3.5).

### Rationale

- Full 2A supercap charging on PoE would push utilisation to ~98%, leaving <2W margin for transient loads.
- 0.5A charge current charges the **8× 25F** supercap bank (2S4P, 50F total — Abracon ADCR-T02R7SA256MB) in approximately 9 minutes from depleted.
- Normal system usage is expected to exceed 30–45 minutes per session (startup + configuration + use), making a 2-minute charge time acceptable.
- This limitation should be documented in the User Manual with guidance that maximum system load is not recommended during the initial PoE power-up window.

### Constraints

- Steady-state PoE load (after caps charged): 50.3W / 72W = **69.9%** utilisation ✓

---

## DEC-005 — TPS25980 eFuse Replaces TPS259474L

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module eFuse (U1)

### Decision

The input eFuse uses a **TPS25980** (7A ILIM, silicon-fixed 16.9V OVLO) rather than the originally considered TPS259474L (5.5A ILIM).

### Rationale

- TPS259474L 5.5A limit is insufficient for worst-case USB-C 15V path at 75W: 75W / 15V = 5.0A + 10% derating = 5.5A — already at the device limit with no headroom.
- TPS25980 (TPS259804ONRGER) provides 7A ILIM (programmed via R3 = 210 Ω) and silicon-fixed 16.9V OVLO, which neatly caps the battery charge voltage window.

### OVLO Constraint

- eFuse OVLO is **16.9V silicon-fixed** (TPS259804ONRGER — no external programming resistor).
- BMS must be configured for **4.1V/cell maximum charge (16.4V for 4S)** to maintain a ≥0.5V margin.
- BMS configurations using 4.2V/cell (16.8V) are not compatible with this eFuse and must not be used.

### ⚠️ Variant Lock — Do NOT change this MPN

The TPS25980 family uses a digit after `TPS25980` to select the OVLO behaviour:

| Variant | OVLO | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TPS259804ONRGER** | **16.9V silicon-fixed** | ✅ **CORRECT — use this** |
| TPS259807 | No OVLO feature | ❌ WRONG — do not use |
| TPS259803 | No OVLO feature | ❌ WRONG — do not use |

This variant has been erroneously swapped to TPS259807 in previous review rounds.
The `04` digit must not be changed without explicit documented justification.

## DEC-006 — STUSB4500 Negotiates 15V/5A (75W)

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module USB-C PD handshake (STUSB4500), USB-C adapter requirement

### Decision

The STUSB4500 standalone PD sink is programmed to negotiate **15V/5A (75W)** from the wall adapter or USB-C PD source. Earlier documentation incorrectly stated 15V/3A.

### Rationale

- 3A (45W) is insufficient for worst-case system load (CM5 at 25W + rotors + supercap charging).
- 5A (75W) provides headroom and aligns with the 75% derating target at the eFuse.
- Users must use a USB-C PD adapter rated for at least 75W (15V/5A or 20V/5A with appropriate negotiation cap).

---

## DEC-007 — Dual Interleaved LMQ61460-Q1 5V Buck (12A)

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module 5V Buck (U2A/U2B)

### Decision

Two **LMQ61460-Q1** buck regulators are used in a **dual interleaved** configuration, providing a combined **12A** output at 5V. Earlier documentation referenced a single LM61460-Q1 (6A).

### Rationale

- Single 6A device is insufficient for CM5 at 25W (5A) + other 5V loads.
- Interleaved dual phase reduces input/output ripple and distributes thermal load.
- 12A capacity aligns with the 9A+ delivery capability of the updated Link-Alpha pin cluster.

---

## DEC-008 — TPS25750 Emulates 5V/5A PD Profile to CM5

> ⚠️ **Superseded by DEC-012** — TPS25750 replaced with TPS25751DREFR. See DEC-012.

- **Status:** Superseded by DEC-012
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** CM5 USB-C PD emulator (TPS25750)

### Decision

The TPS25750 PD emulator advertises a **5V/5A** profile to the CM5 internal USB-C port.

### Rationale

- The CM5 Linux OS will generate a "low power" warning if PD negotiation does not complete at or above 5V/5A (25W).
- 5V/5A is the minimum advertisement to suppress this warning and allow unrestricted CPU/GPU boost operation.

## DEC-009 — Legacy Controller Probe-Access Pin 14 Reassigned to SW_LED_CTRL

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2025 (GND); superseded by final design (SW_LED_CTRL)
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Historical Controller bring-up probe-access concept

> **Supersession note:** Historical-only. See **DEC-040** for the current rule that all Diagnostics
> Banks are removed from the active design specs and will only be reconsidered later during the
> coupon implementation review.

### Decision

The legacy Controller probe-access concept pin 14 was initially reassigned from `3V3_SYSTEM` to
**GND**, following the removal of the `3V3_SYSTEM` rail from all BtB interconnects (see DEC-001).
In the subsequent design pass that added `SW_LED_CTRL` (GPIO 20) to the Link-Alpha signal set,
pin 14 was reallocated to **SW_LED_CTRL** to expose the LED-arbitration handshake at the historical
bring-up probe point.

**Final assignment:** Legacy Controller probe-access concept pin 14 = `SW_LED_CTRL` (GPIO 20, CTRL
→ PM, HIGH = CM5 in control of SW1 RGB LED).

### Rationale

- `3V3_SYSTEM` is no longer available at the Power Module side of this debug header.
- `SW_LED_CTRL` is a useful bring-up observation point — it shows whether the CM5 has taken control
  of the RGB LED from the hardware oscillator fallback path.
- GND is freely available on pins 19–20; a redundant GND at pin 14 added no diagnostic value.

## DEC-010 — INC-14 DEFERRED: Legacy Probe-Access ESD Protection (Post-Prototype)

- **Status:** Deferred — Accepted risk for prototype stage
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Historical Controller bring-up probe-access concept

> **Supersession note:** Historical-only. See **DEC-040** for the current rule that all Diagnostics
> Banks are removed from the active design specs and will only be reconsidered later during the
> coupon implementation review.

### Decision

ESD protection on the historical probe-access concept is **deferred** to post-prototype evaluation.
No TVS diodes or series resistors are added to those bring-up-only signals at this stage.

### Rationale

- The probe-access concept was internal, accessed only by engineers with ESD precautions during
  development.
- Adding ESD protection to every bring-up-only signal adds cost, board space, and complexity before
  there is validated evidence that it is needed.
- Risk accepted for prototype: controlled lab environment, trained operators, no field exposure.

### Post-Prototype Action Required

- During first prototype test phase, evaluate signal integrity and ESD sensitivity on any temporary
  bring-up probe lines.
- If any such lines are exposed to field conditions (e.g., external test connectors), add series
  33Ω + TVS per line.
- Document findings and update this log with the final resolution.

## DEC-011 — All Power Rails on Power Module; 3V3_ENIG Serves Rotor Stack

- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Date:** 2025
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module islands, Controller Board routing, rotor stack power source

### Decision

All power rails are generated on the **Power Module**. The Controller Board's role is purely to **route** power rails onward to downstream boards — it does not generate any rails itself. The rotor
stack is powered by the existing **3V3_ENIG** rail (TPS75733KTTRG3 LDO, 3A). There is no separate Rotor Buck; the erroneous "3.3V/5A Rotor Buck" specification was a confusion with the 5V/5A CM5 rail and
has been removed.

### Rationale

- Centralising all power generation on the Power Module simplifies thermal management (all heat dissipation in one shielded enclosure with dedicated thermal zone).
- Reduces the risk of ground loops and cross-domain sequencing issues.
- The Controller Board as a routing layer keeps its design cleaner and easier to revise independently.
- 3V3_ENIG (3A) covers all 3.3V consumers: CPLDs, USB-JTAG, I2C logic, control signals, and the rotor stack.
- Settings Board RGB indicators are powered from 5V_MAIN via the Stator/Settings 6-pin harness; only
  their control logic remains on 3V3_ENIG.
- ROTOR_EN (CM5 GPIO 16) enables/disables the 3V3_ENIG LDO for sequenced rotor power-up — a control signal only.

### Architectural Rule (permanent)

> All power rails are generated on the Power Module. The Controller Board routes rails to downstream boards only. No buck converters, LDOs, or other power-generating components belong on the
> Controller Board.

### Impact

- `README.md`: Removed erroneous "Dedicated 3.3V/5A Buck" from Controller Board section; 3V3_ENIG correctly listed as Power Module output serving CPLDs, logic, and rotor stack.
- `Power_Module/Design_Spec.md`: 3V3_ENIG scope updated to include rotor stack; 3-island Power Plane retained.
- `Controller/Design_Spec.md`: ROTOR_EN clarified as LDO enable signal to Power Module.
- `Rotor/Design_Spec.md`: Power source updated from "Controller Board Island C" to "Power Module 3V3_ENIG rail".

### Previously Conflicting References (now corrected)

- `README.md` placed the Rotor Buck under the Controller Board section.
- `Rotor/Design_Spec.md` said "sourced from the Controller Board's Island C".

## DEC-012 — U4 TPS25750 Replaced with TPS25751DREFR (NRND Resolution)

- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Date:** 2026-04-03
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module U4, schematic, PCB footprint

### Decision

Replace **TPS25750** (NRND — Not Recommended for New Designs) with **TPS25751DREFR** (PD3.1 certified DRP controller, WQFN-38 6×4mm).

### Rationale

- PD emulation for U4 is required: the Raspberry Pi CM5 must negotiate a 5V/5A (25W) contract from the USB-C PD source to prevent the OS from issuing under-voltage warnings and throttling the system.
- The TPS25751D variant includes the integrated 20V/5A bi-directional power path and a 5V/3A source switch in one package — appropriate for DRP operation that can advertise and deliver the 5V/5A

  profile to the CM5.

- TPS25751 is USB-IF PD3.1 certified (TID#10306); TPS25750 was PD2.0 only and is NRND.
- STUSB4500 (U5) handles the USB-C sink path; TPS25751 (U4) handles the source/emulation path. These are separate and complementary roles.

### Impact

- **Package**: TPS25750 was QFN-28; TPS25751DREFR is WQFN-38 6×4mm. KiCad symbol and footprint to be created when schematic capture begins.
- Mouser: `595-TPS25751DREFR`; DigiKey: `296-TPS25751DREFRCT-ND`; JLCPCB: `C30169739`.

## DEC-013 — L3 EMI Inductor Changed to Bourns SRP1265A-100M

- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Date:** 2026-04-03
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module L3, PCB footprint

### Decision

Replace **Würth 7447789100** with **Bourns SRP1265A-100M** as L3 (EMI DM Pi-filter inductor).

### Rationale

- Würth 7447789100 is not available in any public distributor catalog (not found at DigiKey, Mouser, Farnell, or on the Würth public website). Sourcing without a Würth rep contact is not feasible.
- Bourns SRP1265A-100M is a direct functional equivalent: 10µH, **15.5A Isat** (exceeds 14.5A target with 21% headroom), DCR=16.5mΩ max (better than the original 20mΩ spec), shielded molded SMD.
- Widely stocked: Farnell ~2,741 pcs; Mouser (`652-SRP1265A-100M`); DigiKey (`SRP1265A-100MCT-ND`).

### Impact

- ⚠️ **Package footprint change**: SRP1265A-100M is 13.5×12.5×6.2mm vs 7447789100's 12.5×12.5×6.0mm. PCB land pattern for L3 must use the Bourns 13.5×12.5mm footprint. Clearance to adjacent

  components should be checked during layout.

## DEC-014 — Controller Board Uses ERF8 (Female) on Both BtB Connectors for Blind-Mate Assembly

- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Date:** 2026-04-04
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Controller J1 (Link-Alpha), Controller J2 (Link-Beta), Consolidated BOM connector inventory

### Decision

Both BtB connectors on the Controller Board use the ERF8 female socket: J1 (Link-Alpha) uses **ERF8-040-05.0-S-DV-K-TR** and J2 (Link-Beta) uses **ERF8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR**.
The mating male plugs are fitted to the Power Module (J1, ERM8-040) and the Stator Board (J8, ERM8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR) respectively.

### Rationale

During mechanical assembly, the Controller Board slides into the enclosure and must simultaneously engage with two boards along its back edge
— the Power Module (J1) to one side and the Stator (J2) to the other.
Using female sockets on the Controller allows guided blind-mate engagement in a single insertion motion,
with the mating male pins on the peripheral boards providing positive alignment.
Placing male headers on the Controller would require both peripheral boards to be precisely pre-positioned before the Controller could be inserted,
significantly complicating assembly.

### Connector Assignment Summary

| Board | Connector | Gender | Part |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Controller | J1 (Link-Alpha, from Power Module) | Female | ERF8-040-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
| Controller | J2 (Link-Beta, to Stator Board) | Female | ERF8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
| Power Module | J1 (Link-Alpha plug) | Male | ERM8-040-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |
| Stator Board | J8 (Link-Beta plug) | Male | ERM8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR |

### Impact

- Controller BOM J2 updated from ERM8 (male) to ERF8 (female); JLCPCB C-number to be verified.
- Controller §2 narrative updated to reflect ERF8 on Link-Beta.
- No electrical impact — connector is signal-transparent; pin assignments unchanged.

## DEC-015 — LINK-BETA Connector Reduced from 80-pin to 40-pin (ERF8-020 / ERM8-020)

- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Date:** 2026-04-04
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Controller Board (J2), Stator Board (J8), Consolidated BOM
- **Amended by:** DEC-036 (2026-04-18), DEC-037 (2026-04-18)

### Decision

The LINK-BETA Board-to-Board connector is reduced from 80-pin (ERF8-040 / ERM8-040) to **40-pin
(ERF8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR / ERM8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR)**. The table below records the original
post-reduction allocation; the current active allocation is defined by **DEC-037**.

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | GND | — | JTAG leading shield |
| 2 | TCK | CTRL→Stator | JTAG clock |
| 3 | GND | — | TCK/TMS inter-pin shield |
| 4 | TMS | CTRL→Stator | JTAG mode select |
| 5 | GND | — | TMS/TDI inter-pin shield |
| 6 | TDI | CTRL→Stator | JTAG data in |
| 7 | GND | — | TDI/SPARE inter-pin shield |
| 8 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was SYS_RESET_N — migrated to I²C U7 GPA[7] @ 0x21) |
| 9 | GND | — | JTAG trailing shield |
| 10 | GND | — | Isolation moat pin 1 |
| 11 | GND | — | Isolation moat pin 2 |
| 12 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_IN[0] — migrated to I²C U6 @ 0x20) |
| 13 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_IN[1]) |
| 14 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_IN[2]) |
| 15 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_IN[3]) |
| 16 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_IN[4]) |
| 17 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_IN[5]) |
| 18 | GND | — | Inter-group shield |
| 19 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_OUT[0] — migrated to I²C U6 @ 0x20) |
| 20 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_OUT[1]) |
| 21 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_OUT[2]) |
| 22 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_OUT[3]) |
| 23 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_OUT[4]) |
| 24 | SPARE | — | Freed by DEC-031 (was ENC_OUT[5]) |
| 25 | GND | — | ENC_OUT / TTD_RETURN shield |
| 26 | TTD_RETURN | Stator→CTRL | JTAG TDO short-path return (bypasses rotor stack) |
| 27 | GND | — | TTD_RETURN shield |
| 28–35 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Power pass-through from Link-Alpha; 8 pins × 0.5A = 4.0A |
| 36–40 | GND | — | Power return (5 pins) |

### Rationale

Logic boards downstream of the Stator (Encoder, Reflector, Extension) are 3V3-only — they require
no 5V_MAIN rail. Removing 5V_MAIN from LINK-BETA and rationalising the signal set results in exactly
40 signals. The JTAG block has 5 internal GND shield pins (self-shielded at low-moderate MHz), so only
a 2-pin GND moat is needed between JTAG and the data zone. 8 × 3V3_ENIG pins deliver 4.0A — adequate
for the worst-case 30-rotor stack (2.11 A per Power_Budgets.md). 5 GND return pins plus the 10 other GND pins throughout the
connector provide adequate return paths.

### Poka-Yoke Safety Note

The 80-pin LINK-ALPHA (ERF8-040) and 40-pin LINK-BETA (ERF8-020) on the Controller Board are
**physically incompatible** — the mating connectors cannot be inserted into the wrong socket. This
provides a mechanical safeguard against mismating during prototype bring-up.

### Alternatives Considered

Keeping 80-pin connector with unused pins. Rejected: unnecessary connector cost and PCB area; larger
connector on the Stator increases stack height with no benefit.

### Impact

- Controller J2: ERF8-040 → ERF8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR (female, 40-pin)
- Stator J8: ERM8-040 → ERM8-020-05.0-S-DV-K-TR (male, 40-pin)
- DEC-014 connector table updated (see cross-ref below).

### Cross-ref

DEC-014 (gender assignment rationale remains valid; part numbers updated). DEC-031
(pins 8, 12–17, and 19–24 freed — SYS_RESET_N and ENC_IN/OUT migrated to I²C).
DEC-036 (freed monitor block reallocated into grouped 5V_MAIN / 3V3_ENIG / GND rails).

## DEC-016 — JTAG Controlled Impedance and Series Termination

- **Status:** ✅ ADOPTED
- **Date:** 2026-04-05
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Controller Board, Stator Board, Encoder Board, Reflector Board (noted), Extension Board (noted)

### Decision

All JTAG signal traces on 4-layer and 6-layer PCBs are specified at **50 Ω controlled impedance**
(0.127 mm / 5 mil trace width on outer layers over a contiguous GND plane). Series termination
resistors are added at every cable-driving JTAG output using **75 Ω** (to match the ~100 Ω
impedance of alternating-GND IDC ribbon cable), and at every intra-board or BtB-driving JTAG output
using **33 Ω** (to match the 50 Ω PCB trace impedance).

Full signal-swing analysis confirms the destination CPLD receives full logic swing (3.3 V) in all
cases. The open-circuit reflection at the high-impedance CPLD input doubles the incoming wave back
to full voltage; the series resistor controls the return reflection, not the final voltage.

### Full analysis, all options considered, and trace width calculations

See `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md`.

### Summary of additions per board

| Board | Refs | Value | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Controller | R4, R5, R6 | 33 Ω 0603 | ~~TCK / TMS / TDI series R after 74LVC2G125 buffer, before LINK-BETA~~ **Moved to JDB — see DEC-024** |
| Stator | R7–R9 | 75 Ω 0603 | TCK → J4 / J5 / J6 encoder port outputs |
| Stator | R10–R12 | 75 Ω 0603 | TMS → J4 / J5 / J6 encoder port outputs |
| Stator | R13–R15 | 75 Ω 0603 | TDI chain drive: Stator CPLD TDO→J4, J4 return→J5, J5 return→J6 |
| Encoder | R7 | 33 Ω 0402 | CPLD1 TDO → CPLD2 TDI (intra-board, match 50 Ω PCB trace) |
| Encoder | R8 | 75 Ω 0402 | CPLD2 TDO → J2 connector (ribbon cable drive back to Stator) |
| JDB | R6, R7, R8 | 33 Ω 0402 | TCK / TMS (after U5 buffer) / TDI series damping — before J2 JTAG header |

> **Update (detailed design):** U5 (SN74LVC2G125DCUR buffer) and series damping resistors relocated
> from Controller to JDB during detailed design. LINK-BETA is confirmed as a direct Board-to-Board
> connector (no cable), so 33 Ω series damping applies throughout (not 75 Ω cable-driving rule).
> Controller JTAG lines (TCK, TMS, TDI, TTD_RETURN, VREF) are pass-through — routed directly from
> JDB hat-header to LINK-BETA without active components. See DEC-024.

**Trace width rule added to all 4-layer and 6-layer boards:** 0.127 mm (5 mil) for all JTAG signal
traces on outer layers over a GND plane.

**2-layer boards (Reflector, Extension):** Controlled impedance not practical — 50 Ω would require
a 2.82 mm trace (see `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md §4`). Series termination at cable-driving ends of adjacent
boards provides sufficient protection. Existing Reflector R1 (22 Ω) retained as end-of-chain damping.

> **Superseded (partial):** The Reflector and Extension 2-layer limitations above are superseded by
> DEC-017, which upgrades both boards to 4-Layer JLC04161H-7628. Both boards now have a solid L2 GND
> plane and route JTAG on L1 at 0.127 mm (50 Ω), consistent with all other 4-layer boards.

### Rationale

Achieving 100 Ω PCB traces (to perfectly match the IDC ribbon cable impedance) is physically
impossible on JLCPCB standard 4-layer/6-layer stackups — the required trace width is negative
(see calculation in `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md §4`). The 50 Ω + 75 Ω hybrid approach provides the best
achievable impedance match to the cable while remaining within manufacturing design rules.

### Alternatives Considered

- **No termination (Option A):** Rejected — multiple re-reflections at 10 MHz risk false TCK edges.
- **50 Ω PCB + 33 Ω series R (Option B):** Acceptable but leaves 33% reflection at PCB-to-cable
  transition unabsorbed.
- **100 Ω PCB + 82 Ω series R (Option C, ideal):** Rejected — not achievable on standard stackup.

### Cost Impact

Additional BOM cost per full system < £0.05. No JLCPCB impedance certification required for
prototype; trace widths self-calculated and within ±10% of target. See `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md §9`.

## DEC-017 — Minimum 4-Layer Stackup for All Non-Controller Boards

- **Status:** ✅ ADOPTED
- **Date:** 2026-04-05
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Reflector Board, Extension Board (all other boards already compliant)

### Decision

All PCBs in the Enigma-NG system shall use a minimum of **4-layer stackup** (JLCPCB
JLC04161H-7628). The Controller Board and the Power Module Board are the only exceptions
and retain their 6-layer JLC06161H-2116 stackup: the Controller for high-speed 5 Gbps
differential pair requirements, and the Power Module for high-current power delivery.

### Standard 4-layer layer mapping for all non-Controller boards

| Layer | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| L1 | Signal (JTAG, data routing) — top |
| L2 | GND plane — solid contiguous copper |
| L3 | 3V3_ENIG power plane |
| L4 | Signal (data routing, branding data plate) — bottom |

> **Exception — JTAG Daughterboard:** The JDB uses an inverted stackup: L1=GND plane + SMT
> component pads (component side, faces Controller), L2=signal traces, L3=power pours,
> L4=GND shield (exterior face). This inversion places components on the face that mates
> with the Controller Board hat-headers, consistent with single-side JLCPCB assembly.
> See `JTAG_Daughterboard/Design_Spec.md §4`.

### Boards affected (updated)

| Board | Previous | New |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reflector | 2-Layer 1.6mm FR4 / 1oz | 4-Layer JLC04161H-7628 / 2oz |
| Extension | Layer count unspecified | 4-Layer JLC04161H-7628 / 2oz |

### Boards already compliant (no change)

| Board | Stackup | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stator | 4-Layer JLC04161H-7628 | ✅ Unchanged |
| Encoder | 4-Layer JLC04161H-7628 | ✅ Unchanged |
| Rotor | 4-Layer JLC04161H-7628 | ✅ Unchanged |
| Controller | 6-Layer JLC06161H-2116 | ✅ Exception — high-speed stackup retained |
| Power Module | 6-Layer JLC06161H-2116 | ✅ Exception — high-current power delivery stackup retained |

### Impact

The "2-layer uncontrolled impedance" notes for Reflector and Extension in DEC-016 are superseded.
Both boards now have a solid L2 GND plane and can route JTAG on L1 at 0.127 mm (50 Ω controlled
impedance), consistent with all other 4-layer boards. `design/Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md §3.1`, `§3.3` (now
historical), and `§8` trace table have been updated accordingly.

### Rationale

1. **Uniform stackup:** Consistent JLC04161H-7628 across all non-Controller boards eliminates
   stackup-dependent trace impedance variation, reducing signal behaviour differences between boards.
2. **Solid GND on every board:** All boards now have a contiguous L2 GND plane, enabling 50 Ω
   controlled impedance JTAG routing across the entire system.
3. **EMC/EMI improvement:** Solid GND and power planes on all boards reduce radiated emissions and
   improve common-mode noise rejection across the rotor stack and encoder cabling.
4. **Manufacturing speed:** JLC04161H-7628 is JLCPCB's most common 4-layer stackup, with higher
   stock availability and faster turnaround than 2-layer special orders or less common stackups.
5. **Cost:** Marginal price difference between 2-layer and 4-layer at JLCPCB prototype quantities;
   outweighed by signal integrity and EMC benefits.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Retain 2-layer Reflector/Extension:** Rejected — inconsistent stackup creates impedance
  discontinuities in the JTAG chain and leaves an uncontrolled segment at the reflector end.
- **Use different 4-layer stackup per board:** Rejected — non-uniform dielectric parameters would
  require separate trace width calculations per board and add unnecessary design complexity.

## DEC-018 — Connector Pinout Ownership Model

- **Status:** Adopted
- **Date:** 2026-04-05
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** All Boards — Documentation Architecture

### Decision

Each multi-board connector interface shall have a single **Definition Owner** — the board whose
`Board_Layout.md` (or `Design_Spec.md` where no Board_Layout exists) contains the authoritative
pin-by-pin table for that interface. All other boards that mate with that connector must
**not** duplicate the pin table; instead they include a short cross-reference note of the form:

> **Connector Definition Owner:** `[OwnerBoard]/Board_Layout.md — [Section]`. This board uses the
> mating connector. See BOM for part number.

This rule prevents the class of drift errors where two boards define the same connector differently
(e.g. Pin 2 = GND on one board, SYS_RESET_N on another). When a conflict is found, the owner's
definition is authoritative.

### Ownership Register

| Interface | Connector(s) | Definition Owner | Authoritative Section |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LINK-ALPHA** | PM J1 ↔ Controller J1 (80-pin ERM8/ERF8) | **Power Module** | `Power_Module/Board_Layout.md — LINK-ALPHA` |
| **LINK-BETA** | Controller J2 ↔ Stator J8 (40-pin ERM8/ERF8) | **Controller** | `Controller/Board_Layout.md — LINK-BETA` |
| **Reflector/Extension Link** | Stator J10 ↔ Extension J7/J8 ↔ Reflector J4 (16-pin 2×8) | **Stator** | `Stator/Board_Layout.md — J10` |
| **Encoder Ports** | Stator J4/J5/J6/J7/J8/J9 ↔ Encoder J2 (20-pin 2×10) | **Stator** | `Stator/Board_Layout.md — J4–J9` |
| **Rotor Interface** | Stator J1–J3 ↔ Rotor 1 → … → Rotor 30 → Reflector J1–J3 (serial chain; Extension J1–J6 at group boundaries) | **Rotor** | `Rotor/Design_Spec.md §3.4` |
| **JTAG Daughterboard headers** | JDB J1 (USB 5-pin) + J2 (JTAG 10-pin) | **JTAG Daughterboard** | `JTAG_Daughterboard/Board_Layout.md` |

### Rationale

- **LINK-ALPHA → Power Module:** The Power Module is the upstream power provider; it defines what
  rails and signals it places on the cable. The Controller is the downstream consumer.
- **LINK-BETA → Controller:** The Controller is the JTAG chain master. It originates TCK, TMS, TDI,
  SYS_RESET_N, and the ENC data bus. The Stator is the passive backplane receiver.
- **Reflector/Extension Link → Stator:** The Stator is the signal origin for all ENC data, power,
  and TTD_RETURN carried on this cable. Extension and Reflector are passive pass-throughs or endpoints.
- **Encoder Ports → Stator:** The Stator drives all three encoder cables and has the complete chain
  routing logic for TDI/TDO sequencing across J4/J5/J6. The Encoder boards are the downstream receivers.
- **Rotor Interface → Rotor:** The Rotor defines its own physical interface — both the connector
  type (mechanical) and the signal mapping. Stator, Extension, and Reflector must comply with the
  Rotor's mechanical interface, not the other way round.
- **JTAG Daughterboard → itself:** Self-contained module with no cross-board mating conflicts.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Central `Interfaces.md` document:** Rejected — separates pin definitions from the board they belong
  to, making it harder to keep in sync during incremental design changes. Per-board ownership with
  cross-references is more maintainable.
- **Both sides document the full table:** Rejected — this is the exact pattern that caused the REF-03
  Pin 2 conflict and the REF-01 16/20-pin mismatch found in the April 2026 deep-dive review.

## DEC-019 — PoE Transformer Topology: ACF (Option A) Selected

- **Status:** ✅ Adopted
- **Date:** 2026-04-05
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module — T2 transformer, TPS23730 operating mode, input EMI filter

### Decision

The Power Module retains the **Active Clamp Flyback (ACF)** topology with the **Coilcraft POE600F-12LD**
transformer. The TPS23730 operates in ACF mode, driving an external active clamp MOSFET complementary
to the primary switch. The Coilcraft transformer is procured order-direct from `coilcraft.com` and
supplied to JLCPCB as a consignment part.

No change is made to the T2 transformer, the TPS23730 mode configuration, or the active clamp circuit.

**Full investigation detail:** `design/Electronics/Investigations/PoE_Investigation.md`

### Rationale

A thorough search confirmed that **no ACF PoE isolation transformer for 60W / 36–57V input is stocked
by any mainstream authorised distributor** (DigiKey, Mouser, Farnell, Arrow). The Coilcraft POE600F
family was co-developed with TI specifically for the TPS23730 reference design; no competing catalogue
part exists.

The only standard-distributor alternative identified was the **Bourns PDC060-FD20A12S** — a standard
flyback transformer available from DigiKey. Switching to this part (Option B) would have required:

- Disabling TPS23730 `ACF_GD` (ACF gate drive pin)
- Removing the active clamp MOSFET and capacitor
- Adding an RCD clamp (3 SMD components)
- Verifying PSR auxiliary winding compatibility (unconfirmed)

After detailed EMI/EMC analysis, Option B was rejected on technical grounds. Key findings:

| Criterion | Option A (ACF) | Option B (Flyback) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary switching | ZVS — no hard dV/dt event | Hard switching — fast dV/dt |
| Drain spike at turn-off | None — energy recycled by clamp | Present — RCD clamp clips but does not eliminate |
| CM/DM conducted EMI | Low | 15–25 dB higher before input filter |
| Input EMI filter size | Smaller / fewer components | Larger / more complex |
| CISPR 32 Class B margin | Comfortable | Tight — may require design iteration |
| Efficiency | 88–92% | 85–90% |
| Extra dissipation | — | ~1–2W at full load |
| PSR aux winding verified | ✅ TI reference design | ⚠️ Unverified for Bourns PDC060 |

The Coilcraft direct-order model is accepted as a specialist procurement path, consistent with
industry practice for catalogue magnetics.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Bourns PDC060-FD20A12S (Option B — flyback PSR):** Rejected — hard-switching topology causes
  significantly higher conducted and radiated EMI, requires a larger input EMI filter, does not
  eliminate procurement complexity (shifts effort from transformer sourcing to filter design),
  and adds ~1–2W thermal load to an already thermally constrained module.
- **Würth WE-FB range:** Rejected — entire range has a maximum input voltage of 36V (insufficient
  for PoE 36–57V input) and is keyed to Linear Technology LT-series controllers.
- **Change PoE controller ecosystem:** Not evaluated — would constitute a major redesign and is
  out of scope.

## DEC-020 — GND_CHASSIS Rib Clearway ENIG Bond

- **Status:** Accepted — 2026-04-08
- **Date:** 2026-04-08
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module — Supercap Block Assembly & Board Layout
- **References:** QUE-001, Certification_Evidence.md §2.2

### Decision

The 3.0mm rib clearway gaps between supercap cells shall have:

1. **Exposed ENIG strip (L1):** Solder mask opened in the rib clearway gap on the top copper layer (L1),
   connected to the GND_CHASSIS net. Minimum strip width 1.5mm, running the full depth of the rib contact zone.
   The aluminium enclosure rib makes direct electrical contact with the PCB GND_CHASSIS copper, providing a
   distributed HF chassis ground bond at the supercap block location.

2. **Polyimide (Kapton) tape on supercap bodies:** Each supercap cell shall be wrapped with a minimum of
   one layer of 2-mil (50µm) polyimide tape prior to installation, to electrically insulate the cell body
   from the aluminium compression ribs and prevent short circuits.

3. **Conductive elastomer gasket strip:** A self-adhesive conductive elastomer or conductive foam gasket strip
   (≤3mm wide, full rib contact depth) shall be applied to the rib face or PCB contact zone to accommodate
   manufacturing tolerances and ensure positive, reliable electrical contact under compression.
   Part to be selected at mechanical design phase when rib geometry is confirmed.

### Rationale

The combined structure — aluminium Can lid, compression ribs, conductive gasket, PCB ENIG strip, and
GND_CHASSIS copper pour — forms a near-complete Faraday cage around the supercap block, improving
shielding of the high-capacitance energy storage element from the rest of the board.

### Compatibility with single-point GND_CHASSIS bond rule

The single-point rule governs signal GND → GND_CHASSIS crossings. Rib contact bonds are
enclosure-to-GND_CHASSIS connections — both within the chassis domain — and do not create additional
signal-to-chassis bonds. The rule is maintained.

### Other boards

Deferred pending mechanical design documentation. Controller Board Mechanical_Design.md §3 notes the
prototype uses a 3D-printed chassis (no conductive rib contact); this decision will be revisited when
metal chassis dimensions are finalised. Stator/Encoder/Rotor mechanical designs are not yet written.

## DEC-021 — Supercapacitor Bank Upgrade: 2×2 2S2P → 2×3 2S3P

- **Status:** Superseded by DEC-029 (arrangement 2S3P retained; cell capacitance updated 22F → 25F Abracon)
- **Date:** 2026-04-08
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module — Supercap Bank, Board Layout, Hold-up Specification
- **References:** DR-PM-07, DR-PM-09, DEC-020

### Decision

The supercapacitor bank is upgraded from a 2×2 (4-cell, 2S2P) to a **2×3 (6-cell, 2S3P)** arrangement,
with the inter-cell air gap increased from 2.0mm to **3.0mm**.

| Parameter | Previous | New |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cell count | 4 (C_SC1–4) | 6 (C_SC1–6) |
| Arrangement | 2×2 | 2×3 |
| Configuration | 2S2P | 2S3P |
| Inter-cell gap | 2.0mm | 3.0mm |
| Cell pitch | 14mm | 15mm |
| Block footprint | 28mm × 28mm | 30mm × 45mm |
| Shadow zone | 32mm × 32mm | 34mm × 49mm |
| Effective capacitance | 22F at 5.4V | 33F at 5.4V |
| Hold-up energy | 72.4J | 108.6J |
| Hold-up duration @ 5W | ≥14.5s | ≥21.7s |
| Charge time (depleted) | ~2 min | ~3 min |

### Rationale

- **50% more hold-up:** 33F vs 22F provides ≥21.7 seconds at 5W — a more comfortable shutdown window
  and headroom for higher CM5 load profiles at prototype bring-up.
- **LTC3350 compatibility:** No IC change required. LTC3350 is configured for 2 cells in series;
  each series position now has 3×22F in parallel (66F per position). CELLS register unchanged.
  RICHARGE (0.5A charge current limit) unchanged; charge time increases ~3 minutes from depleted.
- **Wider gap (3mm):** The increased inter-cell gap from 2.0mm to 3.0mm provides adequate clearance
  for the 2-mil Kapton tape wrap (DEC-020), the conductive elastomer gasket strip, and the aluminium
  enclosure compression ribs, while maintaining margin for manufacturing tolerances.
- **Board space:** The Power Module board dimensions are not yet fixed; the design is being built
  around this component block. The increased footprint (30mm × 45mm vs 28mm × 28mm) is accepted.

> **Post-decision update (2026-04-08, checkpoint 025):** The 22F generic cells specified above
> were subsequently replaced with **Abracon ADCR-T02R7SA256MB (25F/2.7V)** when a verified in-stock
> THT radial supercap was sourced. The 2S3P arrangement and all mechanical dimensions are unchanged.
> Effective capacitance increases from 33F to **37.5F**; hold-up increases from 21.7 s to **≥24.8 s**.
> The values **22F / 33F / 21.7 s** are historical and must not be restored.

## DEC-022 — JDB FT232H Clock Source: Dedicated 12MHz SMD Crystal Selected

- **Status:** Obsolete — superseded by DEC-037
- **Date:** 2026-04-06
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** JTAG Daughterboard — Clock Source (FT232H)

### Decision

Dedicated 12MHz SMD passive crystal (Y1) on the JDB PCB. CM5 GPCLK0 option rejected.

### Context

During JDB detailed design review, two issues were identified:

1. The original design incorrectly specified a **24MHz HC-49 through-hole crystal**. The FT232H datasheet requires a **12MHz**
   reference — its internal PLL multiplies 12MHz × 40 to generate 480MHz for USB Hi-Speed operation. 24MHz is outside specification.
2. An alternative was considered: routing a clock from the **CM5 GPCLK0 output (GPIO4)** to the FT232H OSCI pin instead of a dedicated on-board crystal.

### Options Considered

| Option | Description | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | CM5 GPCLK0 (GPIO4) routed through Controller hat-header to FT232H OSCI | **Rejected** |
| B | Dedicated 12MHz passive SMD crystal (Y1) on JDB PCB | **Selected** |

**Option A — Rejected reasons:**

- Signal path: CM5 GPIO4 → Controller board → hat-header pin → JDB OSCI is long and noise-prone
- GPIO clock jitter from BCM is unsuitable as a USB PLL reference clock
- Creates a CM5 boot-order dependency — FT232H cannot enumerate on USB until CM5 configures GPCLK0
- Adds routing and firmware complexity with no benefit over a $0.07 crystal

**Option B — Selected:**

- Standard FTDI reference design approach; clean stable clock source
- No boot dependency; FT232H enumerates immediately on USB connect
- Component: **YXC X322512MSB4SI** (JLCPCB C9002), SMD3225-4P, 12MHz, 20pF, ±20ppm, Basic part
- Crystal load capacitors: C10–C11 = 33pF C0G 0402 (sets 20pF load capacitance)

### Impact

- `design/Electronics/JTAG_Daughterboard/Design_Spec.md`: Y1 corrected to 12MHz SMD3225-4P (C9002); C10–C11 added; text references updated.

## DEC-023 — JDB GND_CHASSIS Omitted; Mounting Holes Tied to GND

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-06
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** JTAG Daughterboard — Grounding & EMC

### Decision

The JTAG Daughterboard (JDB) does **not** implement a `GND_CHASSIS` net. Mounting holes are included
for mechanical stability via conductive standoffs to the Controller board; the copper pours around
those mounting holes are tied to **GND** (circuit return). No dedicated chassis bond pad, stitching
via, or `GND_CHASSIS` net is present on the JDB.

> Cross-reference: DEC-039 keeps the single Power Module bond rule but now makes this JDB treatment
> the generic exception for non-chassis-connected daughterboards.

### Rationale

`GND_CHASSIS` exists to bond a PCB to the metal enclosure for EMC shielding, ESD protection, and safety earth. None of those functions apply to the JDB because:

1. **No chassis surface** — the JDB is an internal daughterboard that floats above the Controller
   board on hat-header pins and conductive standoffs. It has no metal enclosure surface it can
   directly bond to.
2. **EMC envelope already provided** — the Controller board beneath it carries a correctly implemented `GND_CHASSIS` net bonded to the system enclosure. The JDB sits entirely within that envelope.
3. **No external connections** — the JDB has no cables or connectors that exit the enclosure, so there are no ESD entry points that would require chassis bonding at the JDB level.
4. **Low-EMI device** — the FT232H operates at USB 2.0 speeds on an internal point-to-point link. It generates no significant conducted or radiated emissions that would require additional chassis shielding.
5. **Daisy-chaining adds no value** — connecting JDB `GND_CHASSIS` via standoffs to Controller
   `GND_CHASSIS` would create an additional path to chassis earth but no new bond point, adding
   PCB complexity for zero measurable EMC benefit.

### Implementation

- Include **mounting holes** on the JDB for mechanical stability.
- Standoffs are conductive (metal); this incidentally bonds the JDB mounting hole copper pours to the Controller board mechanically.
- Mounting hole copper pours connect to **GND** (circuit return) — not to a separate `GND_CHASSIS` net.
- This is consistent with standard practice for small internal sub-modules (e.g. Arduino shields, FPGA daughter cards).

### Alternatives Considered

- **Standoff bonding to Controller GND_CHASSIS:** Technically implementable but adds a separate net, a copper pour, and design rules for no measurable EMC gain on a low-EMI internal board. Rejected.
- **No mounting holes at all:** Rejected — mechanical retention via standoffs is required to prevent the board from flexing on the hat-headers during connector insertion/removal.

---

## DEC-024 — JDB is Complete JTAG Master; Controller JTAG Lines Are Pass-Through

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-06
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** JTAG Architecture — Controller and JTAG Daughterboard

### Decision

The JTAG Daughterboard (JDB) is the complete JTAG master. The SN74LVC2G125DCUR dual-channel
buffer (U5) for TCK and TMS, and all 33 Ω series damping resistors (R6 TCK after U5, R7 TMS after
U5, R8 TDI direct from FT232H) are located on the JDB, before the J2 JTAG header. The Controller
board routes JTAG lines (TCK, TMS, TDI, TTD_RETURN, VREF) as pass-through from the JDB hat-header
to the LINK-BETA BtB connector without any active components.

LINK-BETA is a direct Board-to-Board connector (no cable). Therefore 33 Ω series damping (matched
to 50 Ω PCB trace impedance) applies throughout — not the 75 Ω cable-driving resistors specified
for ribbon cable connections. See DEC-016 for the full 75 Ω / 33 Ω rationale.

### Rationale

- **Simpler Controller BOM:** Removing U5, R4, R5, R6 from the Controller reduces complexity and
  potential assembly errors on the main board.
- **Cohesive JTAG subsystem:** All JTAG active components and termination are co-located on the JDB,
  which is the natural owner of the JTAG function.
- **BtB confirmation:** LINK-BETA is a Samtec ERF8-020 / ERM8-020 direct board-to-board stack (no
  ribbon cable). The 33 Ω source termination after U5 is the correct value for 50 Ω PCB traces.

### Impact

- `Controller/Design_Spec.md`: U5 removed from BOM; R4, R5, R6 removed; §3 updated to reflect
  pass-through routing; DR-CTL-05 updated; FR-CTL-04 reference to U5 removed.
- `JTAG_Daughterboard/Design_Spec.md`: U5 added to BOM; R6, R7, R8 (33 Ω 0402) added.
- `Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md`: SN74LVC2G125DCUR moved from CTL column to JDB column;
  33 Ω 0402 count increased in JDB; 33 Ω 0603 row removed from CTL.
- `Electronics/Investigations/JTAG_Integrity.md`: §7.4 and §8 updated to reflect JDB location.
- `Design_Log.md DEC-016`: Update note added.

## DEC-025 — CM5 Shutdown Mechanism: Hardware-Driven; LTC3350 Software Support Deferred

- **Status:** Deferred — Software PoC Stage
- **Date:** 2026-04-09
- **Category:** Software
- **Area:** Software / Linux OS — CM5 Power Management Shutdown Path

### Decision

The final implementation of the CM5 graceful shutdown mechanism is **hardware-driven** via the
LTC3350 `/INTB` -> MIC1555 U15 -> Q5 BSS138 -> `PWR_BUT` one-shot path. Any LTC3350 software
support is deferred to the **Software PoC stage**, pending hardware availability for integration
testing, and is limited to I2C telemetry / LED-state handling rather than a dedicated interrupt pin.

The PWR_GD GPIO (GPIO 27, MCP121T-450E output) is rail-health telemetry only and does NOT trigger shutdown. It is a CM5 input that reads HIGH while 5V_MAIN ≥ 4.50V.

### Rationale

- The shutdown path is already covered by hardware, so no Linux interrupt path or device-tree
  mapping is required for safe power-off behaviour.
- Any future software support can read LTC3350 status over I2C without consuming another
  dedicated CM5 GPIO.
- Driver or service development still requires the physical hardware to be available for testing
  and validation.
- The system is designed for operational sessions of 15–30 minutes or longer. The hold-up window
  (≥33.5 s) is a generous safety margin; an unplanned shutdown from a fully-charged state is expected
  to be harmless. Deferring the driver to the PoC stage does not create a risk for hardware bring-up.
- Placeholder notes in design/Software/Linux_OS/Power_Management.md document the intended
  telemetry behaviour for reference; they are not a binding software specification.

### Impact

- design/Software/Linux_OS/Power_Management.md keeps the deferred LTC3350 telemetry notes but
  removes any requirement for a dedicated `/INTB` GPIO or device-tree interrupt mapping.
- The active hardware protection path is the LTC3350 /INTB → MIC1555 U15 → Q5 BSS138 →
  PWR_BUT one-shot circuit (3.01 s LOW pulse), which requires no software driver.

## DEC-026 — Rotor Position Encoder: AS5600 Replaced with Single-Track Capacitive Encoder

> ⚠️ Partially superseded by DEC-028 for dual-track N=64 architecture, Ø92mm PCB diameter, and aluminium shroud milled slots. Retained for historical context.

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-12
- **Category:** Hardware
- **Area:** Rotor Board — Position Sensing (§2.1)

### Decision

The AMS AS5600 magnetic encoder (originally specified in DR-ROT-03) is replaced with a
**single-track absolute capacitive encoder** implemented entirely on the rotor PCB. The rotating
shroud flanges carry milled aluminium slots (air gap = low capacitance); K capacitive sensor pads on the PCB read the track
as a K-bit code. A combinational lookup table in the CPLD VHDL maps the raw sensor code to a
binary rotor position (0 to N−1). The SW1 modulo-N adder (ring setting) operates on the decoded
binary value. No external adder hardware is required — the decode and add are pure CPLD logic.

Three **Texas Instruments FDC2114RGHR** footprints are defined across the split rotor pair;
each rotor variant populates two of them:

- U2 (address 0x2A): Track A — bits[5:3] (N=64) or STGC bits[3:0] (N=26).
- U3 (address 0x2B): Board A STGC bit[4] (N=26 only). NOT POPULATED for N=64.
- U4 (address 0x2B): Track B — bits[2:0] (N=64 only). NOT POPULATED for N=26.
- CPLD implements I²C master to read pad states.

#### Track patterns (verified — all N codes unique)

- **26-char (K=5, N=26):** `00000100011001010011101111`
  Sensors at 0°, 13.846°, 27.692°, 41.538°, 55.385° from reference; arc/segment ≈ 10.63mm at r=44mm.
  Invalid codes (between-character / jam): 11, 13, 21, 22, 26, 31.
- **64-char (K=6, N=64):** Replaced by dual-track 3+3 reflected binary Gray code — see `Rotor_64_Char_Design.md §7` and DEC-028.
  Sensors at 0°, 5.625°, 11.25°, 16.875°, 22.5°, 28.125° from reference; arc/segment ≈ 4.32mm at r=44mm.
  All 64 six-bit codes are valid (standard 6-bit reflected binary Gray code; XOR-chain decode; no invalid-code jam detection required).

PCB outer diameter Ø92mm (inside Ø100mm aluminium shroud) — per DEC-028

### Rationale

- **AS5600 incompatible with single-track Gray code intent:** AS5600 is a single-magnet absolute
  angle sensor — it requires a single magnet on the rotating part and returns a 12-bit angle value.
  It does not implement Gray code sensing and was architecturally inconsistent with the original
  design intent stated in §1 ("single-track grey encoder").
- **No magnet pocket on shroud:** The AS5600 requires a diametrically magnetised magnet (~6mm dia)
  embedded in or attached to the rotating shroud, adding manufacturing complexity. The capacitive
  approach requires only milled aluminium slot patterns on the rotating shroud — no embedded components.
- **All sensing electronics on PCB:** Capacitive pads and FDC2114 ICs are standard PCB components.
  The shroud is a passive mechanical part.
- **Reliable at slow rotation rates:** The rotors step at human-typing speed (≤10 char/s). The
  FDC2114 conversion time (~1ms/channel at default rate) is well within the inter-step interval.
- **STGC lookup table consistent across variants:** Both 26-char and 64-char rotors use the
  identical CPLD decode mechanism; only table contents and modulus differ. No firmware
  architecture difference between variants.

### Impact

- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Design_Spec.md`: FR-ROT-02, FR-ROT-08, DR-ROT-03, DR-ROT-09, §1,
  §2.1 (full rewrite), §3.2 I²C note, BOM U2 → FDC2114RGHR, U3 added.
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_26_Char_Design.md`: §5 ring setting updated; §6 added
  (geometry, track pattern, STGC→position lookup table).
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_64_Char_Design.md`: §5 ring setting updated; §7 added
  (geometry, track pattern, STGC→position lookup table).
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Board_Layout.md`: ASCII diagram updated; PCB Ø92mm (per DEC-028).
- `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md`: AS5600 row replaced with 2× FDC2114RGHR per rotor
  (60 units total across 30 rotors).
- `design/Electronics/Reflector/STGC_Generator.py`: Original script location noted — should be
  relocated to `design/Electronics/Rotor/` in a future tidy-up commit.

## DEC-027 — Rotor Position Readback via JTAG Virtual JTAG (USER0 UDR)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-12
- **Category:** Hardware / Firmware
- **Area:** Rotor Board CPLD — JTAG Interface; GUI App position display

### Decision

The CPLD on each rotor must expose the **effective rotor position** (STGC-decoded position +
SW1 ring offset, mod N) via **Intel Virtual JTAG** (Altera `VIRTUAL_JTAG` megafunction,
USER0 instruction) over the existing JTAG serial chain. This allows the CM5/JDB to read back
all 30 rotor positions in a single JTAG scan pass without consuming any additional PCB pins or
signal routing.

The effective position register is 6 bits wide (covers both variants; 26-char variant uses
bits [4:0], bit [5] = 0). The CPLD VHDL must instantiate the `VIRTUAL_JTAG` megafunction and
connect the effective position register to the user data register (UDR). Cipher substitution
operates continuously and independently of JTAG state.

### Rationale

- **Standard IEEE 1149.1 BSCAN cannot access internal registers:** Boundary scan (EXTEST/SAMPLE)
  captures I/O pin states only. The effective position is an internal CPLD register result and
  would require dedicated output pins to be visible via standard BSCAN.
- **Virtual JTAG avoids pin consumption:** The existing JTAG chain (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO/TTD)
  is already routed through all 30 rotors. No additional pins, traces, or connectors are needed.
- **FT232H on JDB supports arbitrary JTAG instructions:** The JDB FT232H (in MPSSE mode) can
  issue the USER0 JTAG instruction to any device in the chain and clock out the UDR contents.
  The CM5 software can therefore poll all 30 positions by iterating through the chain.
- **GUI App feedback requires position data:** The GUI App Design_Spec requires real-time display
  of rotor positions. Virtual JTAG is the only defined data path from rotor CPLDs to the CM5 for
  this purpose — no I²C, SPI, or dedicated signal lines exist between the rotors and the CM5.
- **Non-intrusive to cipher operation:** The `VIRTUAL_JTAG` megafunction is fully synchronous
  with the JTAG clock domain and does not gate or interrupt the cipher substitution logic running
  on the CPLD system clock.

### Impact

- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Design_Spec.md`: FR-ROT-09 to be added (CPLD exposes effective
  position via JTAG USER0 UDR; 6-bit register; readable without interrupting cipher function).
  Note to be added in §2.2 or §3.3 cross-referencing Virtual JTAG and GUI App.
- `design/Software/GUI_App/Design_Spec.md`: Cross-reference to DEC-027 and JTAG readback path
  to be added when GUI App position-display feature is specified.
- CPLD VHDL (future): Must instantiate `VIRTUAL_JTAG` megafunction and connect effective
  position register. Scan sequence: JDB issues USER0; shifts 6-bit UDR from each of 30 rotors
  serially (180 bits total per full scan).
- `design/Electronics/JTAG_Daughterboard/Design_Spec.md`: FT232H MPSSE mode already specified;
  no hardware change required. Software driver must add USER0 scan sequence.

## DEC-028 — Split dual-board rotor architecture

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-14
- **Category:** Hardware
- **Area:** Rotor Board — Physical Architecture; PCB Assembly; Position Encoder

### Decision

The rotor is split into two circular PCBs (Board A input side, Board B output side), each
Ø92mm, connected by four single-row 2.54mm THT headers (H_SW3 1×7, H_PWR 1×5, H_JTAG 1×5,
H_SENS 1×5; 22 pins total; mixed gender for physical keying). This resolves the
JLCPCB single-side SMT assembly constraint and simultaneously defines the rotor physical
thickness (~15mm with an 11.8mm board gap). Board A carries the CPLD (U1 EPM570T100I5N),
FDC2114 U2 (Track A encoder, bits[5:3] for N=64 or all 5 sensors for N=26), SW1 (ring
setting DIP), SW2 (forward map select DIP), and J1–J3 (ERM8 male, input side). Board B
carries FDC2114 U3 (Track B, bits[2:0], N=64 only — not populated for N=26), SW3 (return
map select DIP), and J4–J6 (ERF8 female, output side). These internal headers are manually
assembled post-JLCPCB SMT pick-and-place.

The aluminium shroud (Ø100mm outer, 4mm radial wall → Ø92mm inner) floats electrically,
retained by rolling-pin style cylindrical bearings with ceramic or nylon rolling elements for
electrical isolation. Gray code position slots are milled into the inner faces of the shroud
flanges (dish side for Track A / Board A; cover side for Track B / Board B). Bare copper
electrode pads on the PCB flat face at r≈44mm sense the pattern capacitively via FDC2114.

For N=64 the encoder is a dual-track 3+3 bit standard reflected Gray code (6-bit), giving
zero multi-bit transitions including wrap-around (position 63→0). The CPLD decodes via XOR
chain (G2B). For N=26 all 5 STGC sensor electrodes remain on Board A; U4 on Board B is not
populated.

### Rationale

- JLCPCB only performs SMT assembly on one side per PCB; splitting the board places all SMT
  components on the outward-facing side of each board, making both boards fully JLCPCB
  assemblable without manual rework of back-side SMT.
- The ~15mm rotor thickness matches original Enigma rotor proportions.
- The split enables a dual-track capacitive encoder (3+3 bits), achieving a perfect 6-bit
  reflected Gray code for N=64 with zero multi-bit transitions at any rotor position including
  the 63→0 wrap. This replaces the de Bruijn STGC approach (which required a lookup table and
  had no wrap-around guarantee).
- The aluminium shroud is passive: no conductive ink, no embedded magnets. Gray code slots are
  milled CNC features on a standard turned-aluminium part. Bearing isolation keeps the shroud
  electrically floating, preventing ground loops and capacitive coupling errors.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Single-board with back-side hand-soldering:** rejected — complex, unreliable, not
  consistent with high-volume JLCPCB assembly.
- **Magnetic encoder on shroud:** rejected — adds active or passive magnetic components to
  the shroud, increasing mechanical complexity and cost.
- **Optical encoder:** rejected — requires more complex shroud features (apertures or
  reflective strips) and additional LED/photodiode components on the PCB inner face.

### Impact

- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Design_Spec.md`: §1 (two-board architecture, Ø92mm PCBs, shroud
  description), §2.1 (rewritten for capacitive encoder with milled shroud flanges), §3.4
  (J_INT internal headers H_SW3/H_PWR/H_JTAG/H_SENS added), BOM split into Board A / Board B, FR/DR updated.
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Board_Layout.md`: rewritten for Board A and Board B with
  stacking cross-section; all Ø100mm references updated to Ø92mm.
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_64_Char_Design.md`: de Bruijn track replaced by 3+3
  dual-track reflected Gray code; XOR-chain decode; geometry updated to r=44mm / Ø92mm.
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_26_Char_Design.md`: single-track all-on-Board-A confirmed;
  geometry updated to r=44mm / Ø92mm; U3 not-populated note added.
- `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md`: J_INT internal headers (H_SW3 PH1-07-UA/RS1-07-G, H_PWR PH1-05-UA/RS1-05-G, H_JTAG PH1-05-UA/RS1-05-G, H_SENS PH1-05-UA/RS1-05-G) added,
  4 headers per rotor assembly (120 total for 30 rotors).

## DEC-029 — Supercapacitor Hold-Up Specification: 25F Abracon Cells, 2S4P, ≥20 s at 15W

- **Status:** Accepted — 2026-04-14
- **Date:** 2026-04-14
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module — Supercap Bank, Hold-up Specification
- **Supersedes:** DEC-004 (cell reference), DEC-021 (cell capacitance and count)
- **References:** DR-PM-07, DR-PM-09, BOM C_SC1–8

### Decision

The supercapacitor hold-up **minimum requirement is ≥20 seconds** at a **15W shutdown load**
(CM5 typical operating current: 5V × 3A = 15W). The confirmed cell selection (Abracon
ADCR-T02R7SA256MB, 25F/2.7V) in a **2S4P (8-cell)** arrangement provides ≥33.5 seconds.

> ⚠️ **Cell lock:** Cells are **Abracon ADCR-T02R7SA256MB, 25F/2.7V** in **2S4P (8 cells)**.
> Stale values **22F**, **33F**, **37.5F**, **21.7 s**, and **24.8 s** must never reappear.
> Any proposed cell or configuration change requires recalculating hold-up against the ≥20 s
> rule below using the **15W** load figure.

### Correct Load Figure

> ⚠️ The CM5 draws **5V × 3A = 15W** during typical operation. When a power-loss event
> occurs, the CM5 is running at this load and continues to draw it throughout the OS shutdown
> sequence (~10–15 s). Earlier documents used 5W (1A) which significantly overstated margin.
> **All hold-up calculations must use 15W** as the minimum design load.

### Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cell part number | Abracon ADCR-T02R7SA256MB |
| Cell capacitance | 25F / 2.7V each |
| Configuration | 2S4P — 8 cells total (C_SC1–C_SC8) |
| Effective capacitance | 50F at 5.4V |
| Charge voltage (2S) | 5.4V |
| Block footprint | 37mm × 77mm (2 columns × 4 rows, 20mm pitch) |
| Shadow zone | 41mm × 81mm |

### Hold-Up Calculation

Usable energy from a capacitor bank discharged from V\_hi to V\_lo:

> **E = ½ × C × (V\_hi² − V\_lo²)**

Load power during shutdown: **P = 15W** (CM5 at 5V × 3A typical).

Hold-up duration: **t = E × η / P**

#### Conservative model (pure-buck — LTC3350 loses regulation at V\_lo ≈ 4.75V)

| Step | Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Usable energy | ½ × 50 × (5.4² − 4.75²) | 164.9J |
| Hold-up @ 15W | 164.9J / 15W | **11.0 s ❌** |

This model is unrealistic — the LTC3350 is a 4-switch synchronous buck-boost, not a simple
buck. It is shown here only to illustrate that relying on the cap voltage staying above the
output voltage is not sufficient at this load.

#### Realistic model (LTC3350 boost mode, V\_lo = 2.0V, η = 80%)

The LTC3350 actively boosts the supercap voltage to maintain 5V output in backup mode.
Minimum practical V\_CAP of ~2.0V protects cells from over-discharge (1.0V/cell for 2S).

| Step | Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stored energy (V\_lo = 2.0V) | ½ × 50 × (5.4² − 2.0²) | 629J |
| Delivered (η = 80%) | 629J × 0.80 | **503J** |
| Hold-up @ 15W | 503J / 15W | **≥33.5 s ✅** |

#### Sensitivity to LTC3350 efficiency at 15W load

| Efficiency | Delivered energy | Hold-up | Pass ≥20 s? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 85% | 535J | 35.6 s | ✅ |
| 80% | 503J | 33.5 s | ✅ |
| 75% | 472J | 31.5 s | ✅ |
| 67% | 421J | 28.1 s | ✅ |
| 48% (minimum) | 302J | 20.1 s | ✅ (edge) |

The ≥20 s rule is satisfied even if converter efficiency degrades to ~48%, which is far below
any credible operating point for a synchronous buck-boost at these voltages and currents.

### Rationale

- **Why 2S4P (8 cells) and not 2S3P (6 cells)?** At 15W, 2S3P (37.5F) delivers 377J at 80%
  efficiency → 25.2 s. This passes the 20 s rule but leaves only 26% margin. 2S4P (50F)
  delivers 503J → 33.5 s, a 68% margin, providing meaningful headroom against LTC3350
  efficiency variation, higher CM5 loads during bring-up, and supercap aging.
- **Why 15W?** The CM5 module draws 5V × 3A under typical operating load. When power is lost,
  the OS shutdown sequence takes ~10–15 s during which the CM5 continues at near-full load.
  Using 5W (1A) as the design load significantly understates the required hold-up margin and
  was an error in DEC-004 and DEC-021.
- **0.5A PoE charge current (from DEC-004) retained:** charge power = 5.4V × 0.5A = 2.7W,
  unaffected by the cell count increase. Charge time from fully depleted ≈ **9 minutes**
  (100F per series position × 2.7V / 0.5A = 540 s). PoE utilisation calculations in
  Certification\_Evidence are unaffected.

### Constraints

- Do not change the cell MPN, cell count, or configuration without re-running the hold-up
  calculation at **15W** against the ≥20 s rule and updating DR-PM-07, DR-PM-09, and this DEC.
- LTC3350 CELLS register must remain configured for 2 series cells (CELLS = 0x01).
- PCB shadow zone: 41mm × 81mm. No traces on L1–L6 within this zone (enclosure rib clearway).

## DEC-030 — 5V_MAIN Backup Switchover Transient Fix (R14, R30, C35)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-14
- **Category:** Electrical
- **Area:** Power Module — LTC3350 Backup Switchover, 5V_MAIN Bulk Capacitance

### Issue

At 3A load (CM5 typical draw), the existing 5V_MAIN bulk capacitance (C9=22µF + C10=22µF +
C13=10µF = 54µF total) provides only 2.59µs before PWR_GD deasserts
(54µF × 144mV / 3A). The LTC3350 at default 200kHz (5µs/cycle) gets only 0.52 cycles
to complete backup switchover — INSUFFICIENT.

### Root Cause Analysis

- Old R14 = 28.7kΩ → backup threshold = 4.644V; PWR_GD deassert = 4.50V; gap = 144mV
- LTC3350 RT=INTVCC (no resistor) = 200kHz → 5µs/cycle
- 54µF × 144mV / 3A = 2.59µs = 0.52 cycles → FAILS

### Fix (three combined changes)

1. **R14: 28.7kΩ → 30.1kΩ** — raises backup threshold to 4.812V; new gap = 312mV
2. **R30: new 33.2kΩ resistor** (LTC3350 RT pin to GND) — sets switching frequency to 400kHz (2.5µs/cycle)
3. **C35: 2× Samsung CL32B226KAJNNNE** (22µF 25V X7R 1210) in parallel = 44µF additional bulk on 5V_MAIN

### Result with Fix

- Total bulk = 54µF + 44µF = 98µF
- Time window = 98µF × 312mV / 3A = **10.2µs**
- Cycles at 400kHz = 10.2µs / 2.5µs = **4.1 cycles ✓**
- False-trigger headroom: 5V×0.98 − 4.812V = 88mV (LTC3350 ~12µs deglitch filters brief dips)

### Component Selection Rationale for C35

- **Selected: 2× Samsung CL32B226KAJNNNE** (22µF 25V X7R 1210, existing BOM part)
  - ESR ≈ 10mΩ (negligible, stable −55°C to +125°C)
  - Uses existing qualified BOM part — no new component qualification needed
  - 4.1 cycles margin at all operating temperatures
- Evaluated and rejected: HZA107M025X16T-F (CDE hybrid polymer-Al, 30mΩ ESR, 4.56 cycles at
  +20°C but marginal 2.1 cycles at −40°C — not selected as existing BOM part is sufficient)
- Evaluated and rejected: KEMET T495X107K025ATA150 (MnO₂ tantalum, 150mΩ ESR — V_ESR = 450mV
  at 3A, EXCEEDS entire 312mV budget; also MnO₂ tantalum short-circuit failure mode is unsafe
  in low-impedance power supply)

### No Change Required To

- eFuse (HV input side)
- LDO TPS75733 (stays in regulation)
- MIC1555/R28/C32 (3.01s timing unchanged)

## DEC-031 — CM5 Virtual Keyboard (Key Injection) Feature Architecture

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-14
- **Category:** Electrical / Firmware
- **Area:** Stator Board — I²C Expanders, Servo, External Keyboard Source Mux
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Design decision for enabling the CM5 to autonomously inject virtual keypresses into the Enigma
cipher pipeline, enabling automated rotor configuration testing and fully autonomous cipher operation.

### Problem

The Enigma machine requires a physical keypress to advance rotors and inject input into the cipher
pipeline. For autonomous CM5 operation (testing, remote cipher operation), a mechanism is needed to
inject keypresses without human intervention.

### Decision

Add three I²C expanders to the Stator board on the shared I²C-1 bus:

1. **MCP23017 @ 0x20 (U6):** 16-bit GPIO expander for ENC_IN/ENC_OUT monitoring. Replaces
   CM5 GPIO 4–15 (12 pins freed).
   - GPA[5:0] = ENC_IN[5:0] monitor (inputs)
   - GPB[5:0] = ENC_OUT[5:0] monitor (inputs)
   - GPA[6:7], GPB[6:7] = spare

2. **MCP23017 @ 0x21 (U7):** 16-bit GPIO expander for virtual key data injection, external
    keyboard-source mux control, and SYS_RESET_N (replaces CM5 GPIO 26 — 1 pin freed).
    - GPA[5:0] = CM5_KEY_DATA[5:0] (outputs — 6-bit virtual key data bus)
    - GPA[6] = KEY_CM5_ACTIVE (output — mux select: 0=physical keyboard, 1=CM5 virtual)
    - GPA[7] = SYS_RESET_N (output — system-wide CPLD reset)
    - GPB[7:0] = spare / reserved

### Rationale for MCP23017 (×2)

- 32 GPIO total provides headroom for future I/O expansion.
- SYS_RESET_N migration to expander reduces LINK-BETA pin count and frees CM5 GPIO 26.
- All keyboard-source mux and reset control signals remain co-located with the Stator CPLD.
- Only 2 wires (I²C SDA/SCL) needed on LINK-BETA instead of 13 discrete signal pins.

### External Keyboard Source Mux

- GPA[6] on U7 drives `KEY_CM5_ACTIVE` for the external keyboard-source mux at the Stator
  keyboard-source entry point.
- `KEY_CM5_ACTIVE=0`: the physical keyboard 6-bit source bus is forwarded to the encryption pipeline.
- `KEY_CM5_ACTIVE=1`: `CM5_KEY_DATA[5:0]` is forwarded instead.
- The selected implementation uses `U4` and `U5`, both `74HC157PW-Q100,118` quad 2:1 mux devices,
  to cover the 6-bit path, with both `E` pins tied to GND so the mux is always enabled while the
  board is powered.
- GPA[7] now carries `SYS_RESET_N`, fully populating the U7 GPA port and leaving U7 GPB
  completely spare / reserved for future use.

### Net Effect on LINK-BETA

- **Freed (13 pins):** ENC_IN[5:0] (×6), ENC_OUT[5:0] (×6), SYS_RESET_N (×1).
- **Freed:** pins 8 (SYS_RESET_N), 12–17 (ENC_IN[5:0]), and 19–24 (ENC_OUT[5:0]) were freed by this decision.
- **Later reuse:** DEC-036 reallocated the former monitor block into grouped LINK-BETA power rails
  (5V_MAIN, 3V3_ENIG, and GND) once the Stator-side 5V needs were formalised.
- R6 pull-up (10kΩ to 3V3_ENIG) on Stator keeps SYS_RESET_N HIGH at power-up (CPLDs out of reset).

### Net Effect on CM5 GPIO

- **Freed (13 pins):** GPIO 4–15 (ENC monitoring), GPIO 26 (SYS_RESET_N).
- No new CM5 GPIO assignments required.

## DEC-032 — Settings Board: Panel-Mount Configuration Controls with CM5 Override

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-14
- **Category:** Electrical / HMI
- **Area:** Stator Board — Configuration Interface; new Settings Board PCB
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Replace the Stator Board's DIP switches (routing + reflector map) with panel-mount toggle switches
plus discrete RGB indicators on a dedicated Settings Board PCB. The Settings Board connects to the
Stator via I²C only (no parallel signal wiring). A new MCP23017 expander (U8 @ 0x22) on the
Stator Board bridges the I²C configuration data to the CPLD config input pins and issues the
Stator-only `CFG_APPLY_N` reload pulse.

### Problem

The Stator's DIP switches (SW1, SW2) are internal PCB components, requiring the enclosure to be
opened to change the routing or reflector map configuration. This is inconvenient for regular use.
Additionally, the CM5 has no way to programmatically override the configuration.

### Decision

1. Remove SW1 and SW2 from the Stator Board.
2. Add a new Settings Board PCB (panel-mount, right side of enclosure top face near rotors) with:
   - 10 panel toggle switches plus 12 discrete RGB indicators (Bank 1 = 4 config toggles + 1 source-status LED, Bank 2 = 6 config toggles + 1 source-status LED)
   - 1 momentary active-low `CFG_APPLY_N` input; a board-mounted tactile switch actuated through the enclosure is acceptable
   - U1 (MCP23017 @ 0x23): reads the Settings Board user-intent config plus `CFG_APPLY_N`
   - U2 (MCP23017 @ 0x24): drives Bank 1 LED anodes + Bank 1 colour rails
   - U3 (MCP23017 @ 0x25): drives Bank 2 LED anodes + Bank 2 colour rails
3. Add U8 (MCP23017 @ 0x22) to the Stator Board. Its outputs drive the CPLD configuration
   input pins directly (`CFG_ROUTE[3:0]` and `CFG_REFMAP[5:0]`). Pull-downs R16–R26 are retained on the CPLD
   input pins to hold safe defaults (all-zero) at power-up before CM5 initialises U8.
4. CM5 firmware (enigma daemon):
   - Reads U1 to get user-intent config state
   - Decides in software whether each bank forwards user intent or uses a CM5-defined preset
   - Drives the bank source indicators via `CFG_ROUTE_CM5_ACTIVE` / `CFG_REFMAP_CM5_ACTIVE`
     (green = user intent forwarded, red = CM5-defined)
   - After writing final config to U8, pulses `CFG_APPLY_N` (U8 GPA[4]) LOW→HIGH to
     trigger a Stator-only configuration reload
5. Physical `CFG_APPLY_N` button on Settings Board: reads via U1 GPB[7]; CM5 daemon polls
   this and triggers the same U8 write + `CFG_APPLY_N` pulse when pressed. The switch may be
   a board-mounted tactile part with a simple actuator/plunger through the enclosure rather than a
   true panel-mount pushbutton.

### LED Colour Scheme

- **Green illumination:** Bank is forwarding Settings Board user intent; illuminated bits show the active forwarded configuration.
- **Red illumination:** Bank is in CM5-defined mode; illuminated bits show the CM5-programmed configuration.
- Per-bank shared colour rail: all switches in a bank share the same colour (green or red) while individual anode control shows which bits are set.

### I²C Address Assignments (new)

| Address | Device | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x22 | MCP23017 (U8) | Stator — CPLD config output driver |
| 0x23 | MCP23017 (U1) | Settings Board — switch input reader |
| 0x24 | MCP23017 (U2) | Settings Board — Bank 1 LED anode + colour rail driver |
| 0x25 | MCP23017 (U3) | Settings Board — Bank 2 LED anode + colour rail driver |

### Rationale

- Replacing DIP switches with panel toggles makes configuration user-accessible without opening the enclosure.
- I²C-centric wiring between Settings Board and Stator keeps the cable harness minimal vs 10+
  parallel signal wires; the active harness is now a 6-wire JST PH link carrying `3V3_ENIG`,
  `5V_MAIN`, `GND`, `SDA`, `SCL`, and a dedicated LED return GND.
- Retaining R16–R26 pull-downs ensures the CPLD receives a safe all-zero default at power-up
  (no plugboard insertion, physical reflector pass-through) before the CM5 writes the desired config.
- CM5 remains the single authority arbiter, allowing GUI presets to forward or override the Settings
  Board user-intent image while still exposing that authority state through the indicators.
- RGB illumination (green/red) provides immediate visual feedback on configuration source with no
  additional UI required.

> **Supersession note:** This decision records the original Settings Board migration intent. The
> active address map and harness definition were later refined by the post-audit cleanup:
> `U1 @ 0x23`, `U2 @ 0x24`, `U3 @ 0x25`, and a 6-wire JST PH harness carrying
> `3V3_ENIG`, `5V_MAIN`, `GND`, `SDA`, `SCL`, `GND`.

### Impact

- **Stator Board:** SW1 and SW2 removed; U8 and J13 added; `CFG_APPLY_N` added to the Stator-only reset/apply path
- **New Board:** Settings Board added to system BOM
- **Firmware:** enigma daemon startup sequence must: read U1, determine final applied config,
  write U8, pulse `CFG_APPLY_N`, update U2 / U3
- **CPLD / reset path:** the Stator-only `CFG_APPLY_N` pulse is combined with `SYS_RESET_N` so the
  Stator CPLD can be reloaded without forcing a global system reset; implemented with
  `SN74LVC1G08DBVR` on the Stator

## DEC-033 — DSI1 Display Connector Provision for Optional Lid Touchscreen

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-14
- **Category:** Electrical / HMI
- **Area:** Controller Board — CM5 display interface; Main Enclosure lid
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Add a DSI1 4-lane FPC connector (J9) to the Controller Board to provision for an optional
lid-mounted touchscreen display, enabling the Enigma-NG to operate as a self-contained machine
without an external monitor. The Display Add-on Board design is deferred.

### Problem

The Enigma-NG currently relies on an external HDMI monitor and USB HID devices for system
management and GUI display. With the CM5 virtual keyboard injection (DEC-031) and Settings Board
(DEC-032) features, the machine is capable of autonomous operation. Adding a lid-mounted touchscreen
completes the self-contained package — the only remaining external peripheral would be a keyboard
and mouse for system administration tasks.

### Decision

1. Add J9 (Amphenol F52Q-1A7H1-11015, 15-pin 1.0mm pitch ZIF/FPC connector) to the Controller Board to expose
   the CM5 DSI1 4-lane interface (CLK +/−, D0–D3 +/−).
2. Route DSI1 differential pairs on L3 (100 Ω differential stripline — same rule as HDMI/USB).
   Traces run from CM5 mezzanine connector pins to J9 near the CM5 socket.
3. Touch I²C (capacitive touch controller SDA/SCL) is routed via the I²C-1 bus already present
   on the Controller Board.
4. `J9` is the only Controller-side display connector fixed in the current scope. Any future
   display power or auxiliary touch wiring remains deferred with the display add-on board definition.
5. The HDMI port (J4) is retained and unaffected — J9 is additive.
6. Display Add-on Board design (lid mounting frame, FPC cable assembly, backlight driver if
   required, touch controller interface) is **deferred** to a future design phase.

### Display Interface

- **Interface:** MIPI DSI1 (4-lane)
- **Differential impedance:** 100 Ω (same as HDMI — no new routing rules)
- **Connector:** Amphenol F52Q-1A7H1-11015 — 15-pin 1.0mm pitch right-angle ZIF/FPC
- **Cable:** Thin FPC routed through lid hinge area (far superior to HDMI cable for hinge flexing)
- **Touch input:** Capacitive touch controller I²C on I²C-1 bus (existing bus, no new wires required)
- **Supported sizes:** DSI1 4-lane supports displays up to 10" at full resolution (e.g., RPi official 10" touchscreen)

### Rationale

- DSI1 FPC cable is thin and flexible — ideal for routing through a lid hinge without fatigue.
- Retaining HDMI preserves external monitor compatibility for development and maintenance.
- The 100 Ω differential rule is already established on L3 for HDMI — no new stackup or impedance work needed.
- Provisioning the connector now (no extra cost, trivial PCB area) avoids a board revision later if the display add-on is adopted.
- I²C-1 bus already has spare address space for a touch controller (e.g., FT5426 at 0x38 or similar).

### Impact

- **Controller Board:** J9 added; ~10 new 100 Ω diff traces on L3; small ZIF footprint on L1 near CM5
- **Main Enclosure:** Lid requires provision for display mounting and FPC hinge routing (see `Main_Enclosure/Design_Spec.md`)
- **Display Add-on Board:** Deferred — to be designed as a separate optional add-on
- **Firmware / OS:** Standard RPi DSI1 display driver; no custom firmware changes needed for basic display output

## DEC-034 — Switch Hardware Refresh: Settings Board Toggle + Discrete RGB LED, Ruggedized PM SW1

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-16
- **Category:** Electrical / HMI / Mechanical interface
- **Area:** Settings Board; Power Module front-panel switchgear
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Replace the old unified Marquardt rocker-switch assumption with two purpose-specific solutions:
E-Switch 200-series toggle switches plus discrete RGB LEDs on the Settings Board, and the Adafruit
4660 rugged metal RGB latching switch for Power Module SW1.

### Problem

The previous design direction forced the Settings Board and Power Module onto one shared switch
family even though the two locations serve different aesthetic, mechanical, and service roles. The
Settings Board benefits from classic toggle controls with separate indicators, while the Power Module
benefits from a sealed, rugged metal power switch with a more robust panel interface and
spade-terminal wiring.

### Decision

1. **Settings Board switch selection:** Use `200MSP1T2B4M2QE` for the 10 configuration toggles
   (`SW_B1[3:0]`, `SW_B2[5:0]`).
2. **Settings Board LED selection:** Use `WP154A4SEJ3VBDZGW/CA` for all 12 Settings Board indicators
   (10 config-bit indicators + 2 source-status indicators).
   - Kingbright 5mm common-anode RGB through-hole LED
   - Full RGB operation is available under CM5 control
   - Separate red, green, and blue series resistors per switch allow colour balancing under nominal 5V operation
3. **Settings Board LED topology update:** Change the indicator drive from the previous
   common-cathode / PNP sourcing concept to:
   - individual LED anode drive from `U2` / `U3`
   - per-bank red / green / blue shared cathode rails
   - low-side BSS138 sink devices on each bank colour rail
4. **Power Module switch selection:** Use Adafruit `4660` for `SW1`.
   - Latching rugged metal power switch
   - RGB ring illumination
   - 16mm panel cutout
   - 2.8mm pin terminals routed to PCB-mounted 2.8mm male spade tabs for serviceable harnessing

### Rationale

- The Settings Board now matches the machine's more period-correct control aesthetic better than a
  rocker-based panel.
- Separate LEDs give more freedom over indicator placement and future panel detailing than
  integrated illuminated switches.
- The Power Module switch benefits from a tougher sealed metal body and clearer power-switch
  identity than the previous shared-family concept.
- Breaking the false BOM unification removes a mechanical compromise that was not buying any real
  electrical simplification.

### Impact

- **Settings Board Design_Spec / Board_Layout:** switch type, LED type, and LED driver polarity all
  change
- **Consolidated BOM:** split the old shared rocker line into distinct Settings Board and Power
  Module entries
- **Power Module Design_Spec:** SW1 selection and harnessing updated to the rugged metal switch
- **Copilot handoff / component tracking:** the old Marquardt-all-13-switches assumption is retired

## DEC-035 — HID Keyboard and Lightboard Use a 40-Position QWERTY-Derived Layout for the 64-Character Code Space

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-17
- **Category:** HMI / Mechanical interface / HID logic
- **Area:** HID Assembly; Encoder Board; Rotor actuation interface
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Freeze the HID operator interface as a **40-position physical layout** rather than a 64-key physical
array. The printable positions are `[a-z0-9+=]`, with **Left Shift** and **Right Shift** on the
bottom row to access uppercase alphabetic codes. The machine still retains its full 64-character
logical alphabet.

### Problem

Older docs had drifted toward describing the HID assembly as a literal 64-key keyboard, which no
longer matched the intended operator experience. That made the purchased keyboard-switch quantity,
mechanical lever count, and Encoder input mapping ambiguous, and risked re-introducing separate
uppercase-only key positions that were never part of the intended user-facing layout.

### Decision

1. **Physical keyboard layout:** Use **40 total switch positions** in the HID keyboard.
   - 26 lowercase alphabetic keycaps: `a-z`
   - 10 numeric keycaps: `0-9`
   - 2 symbol keycaps: `+` and `=`
   - 2 modifier keycaps: **Left Shift** and **Right Shift**
2. **Logical 64-character repertoire:** Preserve the full 64-character code space in Encoder logic.
   - Unshifted alphabetic keys emit `a-z`
   - Shifted alphabetic keys emit `A-Z`
   - Digits and `+` / `=` are unchanged by Shift
   - Therefore the HID path still covers 26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 10 digits + 2 symbols = 64
     unique character codes
3. **Physical lightboard layout:** Mirror the same QWERTY-derived printable positions on the
   lightboard instead of introducing dedicated uppercase-only legends or lamp locations.
4. **Mechanical interface:** The rotor actuation mechanism shall therefore be designed around
   **40 physical key levers**, not 64.

### Rationale

- This matches the intended operator experience of a keyboard-like panel instead of an abstract
  64-button matrix.
- It preserves the full 64-character cipher alphabet without wasting front-panel area on
  duplicated uppercase-only key positions.
- It aligns the purchased custom keyboard switch count and the HID mechanical packaging with a more
  realistic enclosure layout.

### Impact

- **HID Assembly Design_Spec:** layout, key count, and purchased switch definition fixed at 40
  positions
- **Encoder Design_Spec:** HID mapping clarified as 40 physical inputs projected into a 64-code
  logical space
- **Rotor Actuation Assembly:** lever count reduced from 64 to 40
- **Consolidated BOM / component tracking:** keyboard switch quantity updated to 40 and tied to the
  pseudo datasheet for the purchased marketplace part

## DEC-036 — LINK-BETA Former Monitor Pins Reallocated as Grouped Power Rails

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-18
- **Category:** Electrical / Power distribution
- **Area:** Controller Board J2 (LINK-BETA), Stator Board J8, Settings/Servo 5V branch
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Keep LINK-BETA as the 40-pin Samtec ERF8/ERM8 pair from DEC-015, but stop carrying a large legacy
spare block. Reallocate the former ENC monitor positions into grouped power rails: **4 contiguous
5V_MAIN pins**, **3 additional 3V3_ENIG pins**, and **3 additional GND return pins**.

### Problem

After DEC-031 migrated ENC_IN/ENC_OUT monitoring and SYS_RESET_N to Stator-side I²C expanders, a
large section of LINK-BETA remained unused. That left the connector under-utilised while the
Stator-side 5V branch had only 2 pins (1.0A connector capacity) available for the servo and the
Settings Board indicator rail.

### Decision

Retain the 40-pin LINK-BETA connector and apply this active allocation:

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | GND | — | JTAG leading shield |
| 2 | TCK | CTRL→Stator | JTAG clock |
| 3 | GND | — | TCK/TMS inter-pin shield |
| 4 | TMS | CTRL→Stator | JTAG mode select |
| 5 | GND | — | TMS/TDI inter-pin shield |
| 6 | TDI | CTRL→Stator | JTAG data in |
| 7 | GND | — | TDI/GND inter-pin shield |
| 8 | GND | — | Extra JTAG trailing/guard ground |
| 9 | GND | — | JTAG trailing shield |
| 10 | GND | — | Isolation moat pin 1 |
| 11 | GND | — | Isolation moat pin 2 |
| 12 | I2C1_SDA | Bidir | Shared Stator/Settings I²C-1 data extension |
| 13 | I2C1_SCL | Bidir | Shared Stator/Settings I²C-1 clock extension |
| 14 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 15 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 16 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 17 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 18 | GND | — | 5V_MAIN return moat |
| 19 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Additional 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 20 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Additional 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 21 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Additional 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 22 | GND | — | Grouped return for the mixed-power block |
| 23 | GND | — | Grouped return for the mixed-power block |
| 24 | GND | — | Grouped return for the mixed-power block |
| 25 | GND | — | TTD_RETURN leading shield |
| 26 | TTD_RETURN | Stator→CTRL | JTAG TDO short-path return |
| 27 | GND | — | TTD_RETURN trailing shield |
| 28–35 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Existing 3V3_ENIG pass-through block |
| 36–40 | GND | — | Main power return block |

### Rationale

- The connector footprint, mating safety, and stack geometry from DEC-015 stay unchanged.
- Grouping all four 5V_MAIN pins together simplifies routing and clearly separates the 5V branch
  from the I²C and JTAG regions.
- 4 × 5V_MAIN pins provide **2.0A connector capacity**, giving ample headroom above the current
  0.74A downstream budget (Settings Board indicators + servo).
- The extra 3V3_ENIG pins make LINK-BETA electrically overprovisioned, so the upstream 3.0A LDO
  remains the only practical 3V3 limit.

### Impact

- Controller / Stator LINK-BETA tables updated to grouped 5V_MAIN, 3V3_ENIG, and GND allocations
- Settings Board and Stator docs updated to source `5V_MAIN` from LINK-BETA pins **14–17**
- Historical Controller probe-access concept repurposed from unused spare pads to power/I²C
  bring-up probes

### Cross-ref

DEC-015 (40-pin connector retained). DEC-031 (freed the former monitor pins). DEC-034
(Settings Board full-RGB 5V indicator branch creates a standing Stator-side 5V load). DEC-040
(all Diagnostics Banks removed from active specs; revisit only during coupon review).

## DEC-037 — LINK-BETA Pin Map Regrouped Around Dedicated JTAG and I2C Guard Bands

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-18
- **Category:** Electrical / Interconnect definition
- **Area:** Controller Board J2 (LINK-BETA), Stator Board J8, historical Controller bring-up probe concept
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Retain the 40-pin LINK-BETA connector from DEC-015, but replace the DEC-036 allocation with a cleaner
rail-and-guard arrangement: front power cluster, front 3V3 cluster, dedicated guarded JTAG block,
guarded I2C pair, then a rear power cluster. This becomes the only active LINK-BETA pin-definition
table.

### Problem

DEC-036 solved the spare-pin problem, but the resulting active map split `3V3_ENIG` into a small
middle block plus a rear block and left the overall pin order harder to reason about in board docs
and bring-up references. The design intent now is to preserve a dedicated guarded JTAG region, keep
`TTD_RETURN` near that JTAG region, keep I2C shielded, and make the remaining rails cleaner to read
without relying on historical "additional" or "pass-through" distinctions.

### Decision

Adopt this LINK-BETA allocation as the active mapping:

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | GND | — | Front power return / guard |
| 2 | GND | — | Front power return / guard |
| 3 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 4 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 5 | GND | — | Front power return / guard |
| 6 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 7 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 8 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 9 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 10 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 11 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 12 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 13 | GND | — | Front 3V3 return / guard |
| 14 | GND | — | Front 3V3 return / guard |
| 15 | TCK | CTRL→Stator | JTAG clock |
| 16 | GND | — | TCK/TMS guard |
| 17 | TMS | CTRL→Stator | JTAG mode select |
| 18 | GND | — | TMS/TDI guard |
| 19 | TDI | CTRL→Stator | JTAG data in |
| 20 | GND | — | TDI/TTD_RETURN guard |
| 21 | TTD_RETURN | Stator→CTRL | JTAG TDO short-path return |
| 22 | GND | — | TTD_RETURN trailing guard |
| 23 | GND | — | JTAG/I2C isolation ground |
| 24 | I2C1_SDA | Bidir | Shared Stator/Settings I²C-1 data extension |
| 25 | GND | — | SDA/SCL guard |
| 26 | I2C1_SCL | Bidir | Shared Stator/Settings I²C-1 clock extension |
| 27 | GND | — | I2C/rear-power isolation ground |
| 28 | GND | — | Rear power guard |
| 29 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 30 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 31 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 32 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 33 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 34 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 35 | 3V3_ENIG | PM→Stator | Grouped 3V3_ENIG feed |
| 36 | GND | — | Rear 3V3 return / guard |
| 37 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 38 | 5V_MAIN | PM→Stator | Grouped 5V_MAIN feed |
| 39 | GND | — | Rear power return / guard |
| 40 | GND | — | Rear power return / guard |

### Rationale

- Preserves a dedicated guarded JTAG block and keeps `TTD_RETURN` adjacent to the other JTAG nets.
- Preserves a separately guarded I2C pair instead of burying it inside a mixed power cluster.
- Keeps **4 × `5V_MAIN` pins = 2.0A connector capacity**, which remains above the current
  **0.74A** downstream Stator-side 5V budget.
- Expands LINK-BETA to **14 × `3V3_ENIG` pins = 7.0A connector capacity**, so the connector remains
  comfortably above the upstream **3.0A** LDO limit.
- Removes active-doc wording distinctions like "additional" or "pass-through" from the pin map; the
  table is now a straightforward interface definition.

### Supersession / Obsolescence

- **DEC-036 is obsolete** and retained only as historical traceability for the prior grouped-rail map.
- The **pin-allocation tables** recorded in **DEC-015** and **DEC-036** are obsolete as active
  interface definitions; DEC-037 is now the sole authority for LINK-BETA pin placement.
- **DEC-031** remains valid as the historical migration of `SYS_RESET_N` and `ENC_IN/ENC_OUT` off the
  connector, but it no longer defines the active pin order.

### Impact

- Controller and Stator LINK-BETA tables updated to the DEC-037 map.
- Power-budget docs updated to the new **7.0A** LINK-BETA `3V3_ENIG` connector capacity.
- Stator/Settings power-feed references updated to the new `5V_MAIN` pins **3, 4, 37, 38**.
- Historical Controller bring-up probe concept remapped to the new LINK-BETA rail and control-pin
  positions.

### Cross-ref

DEC-015 (40-pin connector retained), DEC-031 (functions moved off the connector), DEC-034
(Stator-side 5V indicator load), DEC-036 (obsolete prior grouped-rail map), DEC-040
(all Diagnostics Banks removed from active specs; revisit only during coupon review).

## DEC-038 — Controller-Centric Dock Architecture Replaces Legacy Link-Alpha / Link-Beta Backplane

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-19
- **Category:** Mechanical / Electrical partitioning
- **Area:** Controller Board, Power Module, Stator, system interconnect architecture
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Retire the legacy Samtec `LINK-ALPHA` and `LINK-BETA` board-to-board model for the Controller ↔ Power
Module and Controller ↔ Stator interfaces. The Controller becomes the fixed motherboard and enclosure-edge
I/O carrier; the Power Module and Stator become removable daughtercards docked into the Controller.

### Problem

The former dual-blind-mate Samtec architecture assumed the Power Module and Stator both attached directly
to the Controller through high-pin-count mezzanine connectors. That arrangement no longer matches the
enclosure-driven mechanical direction:

- the **Controller** now owns all external I/O placement
- the **Power Module** is a removable power cartridge rather than the I/O edge board
- the **Stator** is a removable vertical daughterboard that must be supported against rotor mass

The old Link-Alpha / Link-Beta definitions also forced low-current Samtec contacts to carry large grouped
power allocations and kept obsolete direct PM status GPIOs alive even though a shared `I2C-1` bus already
reaches the PM.

### Decision

#### 1. Controller owns RJ45 / Ethernet / PoE entry

The Controller Board now owns:

- RJ45 connector
- Ethernet ESD and magnetics handling
- PoE PD / ACF front-end
- the local cable-entry shield / chassis island for those connectors

The Power Module no longer carries RJ45, Ethernet LED return lines, or GbE MDI routing.

#### 2. Power Module becomes a power-conditioning / UPS cartridge

The Power Module now receives a **regulated PoE-derived auxiliary feed** from the Controller instead of
raw Ethernet-adjacent PoE circuitry. It continues to host:

- USB-C PD input
- smart-battery input
- OR-ing / filtering / eFuse
- supercap hold-up
- `5V_MAIN` and `3V3_ENIG` generation

#### 3. Controller ↔ Power Module dock is split into three TE connectors

Use three copies of the TE 10-position 2.5 mm board-to-board pair:

- Controller side receptacle: **`1-1674231-1`**
- Power Module side plug: **`1123684-7`**

Active partition:

| Link | Function | Allocation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `J1A` | main regulated rails | `3 × 5V_MAIN`, `2 × 3V3_ENIG`, `5 × GND` |
| `J1B` | PoE auxiliary handoff | `3 × VIN_POE_12V`, `7 × GND` |
| `J1C` | low-speed control / telemetry | `I2C1_SDA`, `I2C1_SCL`, `PM_IO_INT_N`, `PWR_GD`, `ROTOR_EN`, `PWR_BUT`, `4 × GND` |

#### 4. Controller ↔ Stator dock uses two Molex hybrid connectors

Use the Molex EXTreme Guardian HD pair:

- Controller receptacle: **`2195630015`**
- Stator plug: **`2195620015`**

Active partition:

- **5V dock (`J2A`)**: `4 × 5V_MAIN` power blades, `1 × GND` power blade, signal field used as extra
  `GND` returns / guards
- **3V3 / logic dock (`J2B`)**: `4 × 3V3_ENIG` power blades, `1 × GND` power blade, guarded signal field
  carrying `TCK`, `TMS`, `TDI`, `TTD_RETURN`, `I2C1_SDA`, and `I2C1_SCL`; all remaining signal contacts tied to `GND`

This retains the JTAG cluster on the `3V3_ENIG` / logic-biased connector and gives the Stator two
mechanical support points instead of one fine-pitch mezzanine connector.

#### 4a. Controller owns the local servo actuation interface

Because the Stator is now a removable **vertical** daughterboard, the servo motor and its home switch
must remain close to the mechanical depression-bar linkage rather than hanging off the Stator PCB.
The Controller therefore owns the full local servo electrical interface:

- **J11** on the Controller carries `5V_MAIN`, `GND`, and `SERVO_PWM`
- **SW3 / SERVO_HOME** is mounted on the Controller with a local pull-up and debounce network
- **CM5 GPIO 12** provides direct 50 Hz `SERVO_PWM`
- **CM5 GPIO 17** reads the active-low `SERVO_HOME` input

No I²C expander-owned servo GPIO and no standalone PCA9685 PWM driver are used in the active design.

#### 5. PM-local I2C expander replaces legacy direct PM status GPIOs

Add **`PCA9534APWR`** on the Power Module at **I2C address `0x3F`**. Use it for:

- **inputs:** `POE_STAT`, `SYS_FAULT`, `BATT_PRES_N`, `USB_STAT`
- **outputs:** `SW_LED_R`, `SW_LED_G`, `SW_LED_B`, `SW_LED_CTRL`

Retain only these direct PM lines:

- `PWR_BUT`
- `PWR_GD`
- `ROTOR_EN`

#### 6. PM RGB sink stage follows the Settings Board pattern

The PM runtime RGB path uses three low-side `BSS138` stages with `1kΩ` gate resistors and gate
pull-down resistors. The pre-boot hardware flash path remains **red + green only** via `Q4` and `D6/D7`;
blue is runtime-only.

#### 7. Grounding rule is unchanged

The **only** intentional DC bond between `GND` and `GND_CHASSIS` remains on the Power Module before the
eFuse. The Controller may host local shield/chassis handling for cable-entry hardware, but it must not
create a second galvanic bond to system ground.

### Rationale

- Matches the enclosure-driven mechanical architecture.
- Moves high-speed / external I/O ownership to the board that already carries the CM5 and user-facing ports.
- Replaces over-loaded fine-pitch Samtec power transport with dock connectors better suited to grouped power.
- Keeps PM-local housekeeping close to the PM circuits instead of wasting direct CM5 GPIOs on status lines
  that already terminate on the PM.
- Keeps PM devices clustered in `i2cdetect` by placing the expander at `0x3F`, adjacent to the PM INA219 at `0x40`.

### Supersession / Obsolescence

- **DEC-014** is obsolete as an active definition for Controller blind-mate BtB connectors.
- **DEC-015** and **DEC-037** are obsolete as active Controller ↔ Stator interface definitions.
- The names **`Link-Alpha`** and **`Link-Beta`** are retained only for historical traceability in older
  documents; the active architecture uses `J1A/J1B/J1C` and `J2A/J2B`.
- Rotor / Extension / Reflector Samtec Edge-Rate connectors are **not** affected by this decision.

### Impact

- Controller, Power Module, and Stator design specs must be updated to the new dock model.
- Controller PoE / Ethernet ownership moves out of the Power Module docs and BOM ownership.
- Servo motor electrical ownership moves from the Stator to the Controller so the actuation hardware
  remains co-located with the rotor depression bar in the vertical-Stator enclosure layout.
  The following Stator requirements were retired as a result (IDs at time of retirement; the active
  spec has since been renumbered to close the gaps):
  - **FR-STA-11** (servo PWM output, original numbering) — superseded by Controller-local direct CM5 GPIO PWM.
  - **FR-STA-12** (SERVO\_HOME sensing, original numbering) — superseded by Controller-local home-switch input.
  - **DR-STA-13** (I²C PWM driver, original numbering) — servo PWM generation moved to direct CM5 GPIO.
  - **DR-STA-14** (servo connector, original numbering) — connector ownership moved to the Controller.
  - **DR-STA-15** (SERVO\_HOME switch, original numbering) — home-switch ownership moved to the Controller.
- PM GPIO / SW1 RGB runtime control moves to `PCA9534APWR @ 0x3F`.
- Power-budget and overview documents must stop referencing Samtec Link-Alpha / Link-Beta as active
  PM/Stator bottlenecks.

## DEC-039 — Enclosure-Connected Boards Use GND_CHASSIS; Daughterboards Are Exempt

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-20
- **Category:** Electrical / EMC
- **Area:** All boards — grounding, mounting, and enclosure bonding
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Standardise `GND_CHASSIS` across the enclosure-connected parts of the system: every
enclosure-connected board carries a local `GND_CHASSIS` net tied to its mounting holes and any
deliberate enclosure-contact or shield-contact features, while non-chassis-connected daughterboards
are exempt. The only galvanic `GND` ↔ `GND_CHASSIS` bond remains on the Power Module at the common
power-entry point immediately before the eFuse.

### Problem

The prior documentation mixed two different grounding models:

- some documents treated `GND_CHASSIS` as a board-specific feature used only on externally exposed
  boards
- other documents already relied on a shared chassis domain and a single Power Module bond point
- JDB-specific wording in DEC-023 needed to remain valid, but the prior update had over-corrected by
  requiring even non-chassis-connected daughterboards to implement `GND_CHASSIS`

That ambiguity makes isolated board review harder and risks future designs creating inconsistent
mounting-hole grounding or accidental secondary bond points.

### Decision

1. **Every enclosure-connected board implements `GND_CHASSIS`.**
   - Tie mounting holes and other defined enclosure-contact / shield-contact mechanical features to
     the local `GND_CHASSIS` net.
   - This applies to removable boards and fixed boards that bond into the enclosure structure.

2. **Non-chassis-connected daughterboards are exempt.**
   - Board-mounted daughterboards that do not connect directly to the enclosure do not need their own
     `GND_CHASSIS` net.
   - They are treated as electrical / mechanical extensions of the host board instead.
   - The JTAG Daughterboard (JDB) is the canonical example of this exception.

3. **The enclosure is the distributed chassis return path.**
   - The metal enclosure and bonded mounting hardware form one continuous chassis domain across the
     machine.
   - Transients and shield currents are intended to flow through that chassis domain toward the
     single galvanic bond instead of being dumped into local logic/power `GND` on intermediate boards.

4. **Only the Power Module may bond `GND` to `GND_CHASSIS`.**
   - The sole intentional galvanic bond is at the common power-entry point on the Power Module,
     immediately before the eFuse.
   - This location is downstream of the source-selection / OR-ing stage, so the bond point remains
     correct regardless of whether PoE, USB-C, or battery input is active.

5. **Local board restriction.**
   - All non-Power-Module boards that implement `GND_CHASSIS` must keep that local chassis net
     isolated from signal/power `GND`.
   - Local connector shields, EMI landing pads, and mounting features may join the chassis domain,
     but they must not create a second DC bond.

### Rationale

- Gives enclosure-connected boards the same grounding rule when viewed in isolation.
- Preserves the legitimate exemption for internal hat/daughterboard modules.
- Makes mounting-hole treatment consistent across all PCB designs.
- Preserves the EMC intent of using the enclosure as the transient/shield return path.
- Keeps the single-point bond at the best location for all input-source combinations.

### Supersession / Obsolescence

- **DEC-023** remains valid as the concrete JDB instance of the daughterboard exemption.
- Earlier wording in the Global Routing Spec that left the exemption implicit and under-specified is
  obsolete.

### Impact

- Update `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md` to make the enclosure-connected-board rule and
  daughterboard exemption explicit.
- Add or revise grounding cross-references in every board-level `Design_Spec.md` so the single-bond
  rule is visible even when a board spec is read on its own.
- Keep the Power Module documentation explicit that the single bond is located at the common
  power-entry point immediately before the eFuse.

## DEC-040 — Diagnostics Banks Removed from Active Design Specs Pending Coupon Review

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-25
- **Category:** Documentation / Test-access strategy
- **Area:** All boards — active design specs, board layouts, and future coupon planning
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

All Diagnostics Banks have been removed from all design specs, as these are not production board
components and will be re-addressed later when reviewing the coupon implementations TODO item.

### Problem

The documentation had drifted into an inconsistent state:

- some active `Design_Spec.md` and `Board_Layout.md` files still described Diagnostics Banks or
  related future test-access details
- the finished machine is not intended to carry permanent Diagnostics Bank hardware
- the coupon strategy is already tracked separately as future work, so embedding those details into
  current board specs makes the active design harder to review

That mixed future test-access planning into documents that are supposed to define the current
production-board design.

### Decision

1. **Remove all Diagnostics Bank details from active board specs/layouts.**
   - No active `Design_Spec.md` or `Board_Layout.md` should describe Diagnostics Banks as if they are
     present on the current production boards.
   - Future test-access features must not appear as active board content before they are actually
     designed.

2. **Keep historical traceability in the Design Log only.**
   - Older Diagnostics Bank discussions remain in this log as historical context.
   - Where needed, those older entries are treated as superseded historical material rather than
     active design definition.

3. **Revisit test-access details only during the coupon work item.**
   - Any future removable coupon implementation is to be reviewed later under **OWI-001 — Test
     Coupons per Board**.
   - Per-board coupon signal selection, geometry, connector choices, and any related probe-access
     strategy are deferred until that dedicated review.

4. **Require a fresh review before any reintroduction.**
   - If test-access features are reintroduced later, they require a new explicit design update and
     the appropriate ESD / certification review at that time.

### Rationale

- Keeps active board docs focused on the actual production-board design.
- Avoids presenting future bring-up hardware as though it were already approved.
- Preserves the test-coverage intent without prematurely freezing implementation details.
- Makes the separation between **current design** and **future TODO work** explicit.

### Supersession / Obsolescence

- **DEC-009** and **DEC-010** remain historical traceability for the old Controller probe-access
  concept, but they are superseded as active board-definition guidance by this decision.
- Any historical references to Diagnostics Banks or equivalent fixed bring-up probe features in the
  active board specs/layouts are obsolete.

### Impact

- Active board `Design_Spec.md` and `Board_Layout.md` files must omit Diagnostics Bank content until
  the coupon work is actually designed.
- Future test-access planning stays in the Design Log / work-item tracking rather than in current
  board specs.
- Later coupon implementation work must decide the real test-access architecture per board instead of
  inheriting outdated fixed-bank assumptions.

## DEC-041 — Encoder Modules Use EPM570 with Digital Debounce and Role-by-Programming

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Category:** Electrical / Logic architecture
- **Area:** Encoder Module hardware, CPLD logic partitioning, manufacturing standardisation
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Standardise all six Encoder Modules on the **Intel MAX II `EPM570T100I5N`** and move encode-role
input debouncing from external per-line RC networks into the CPLD logic. The Encoder PCB remains a
single universal board; role is selected by the programmed CPLD image rather than by role-specific
passive population or local switches.

### Problem

The prior Encoder direction left the active design in a fragmented state:

- Encoder boards were the only active MAX II boards still specified around the smaller `EPM240`
  device while Rotor and Stator already used `EPM570`
- encode-role boards required a large role-specific RC population (`64 × 10 kΩ` + `64 × 100 nF`)
  even though the same PCB was intended to stay generic
- role-identifying population differences made bulk manufacturing and board identification less
  robust than a single common programmable hardware standard
- the active docs described hardware debounce even though the new universal-board direction benefits
  from logic-side filtering and future LE headroom

That combination increased BOM complexity and left less architectural margin for future Encoder-side
logic work.

### Decision

1. **All Encoder Modules use `EPM570T100I5N`.**
   - The Encoder `U1` device is upgraded from `EPM240T100I5N` to `EPM570T100I5N`.
   - Encoder, Rotor, and Stator now share the same active MAX II CPLD part number.

2. **Encode-role debounce moves into CPLD logic.**
   - Active board designs must not rely on the former external per-line RC debounce network as the
     primary debounce method.
   - The active logic architecture uses sampled digital filtering of the 64-line input bank.
   - Debounce tuning is intentionally left prototype-adjustable in the logic specification until the
     first hardware is available for measurement.

3. **Role is selected by programming, not by board switches or role-only passives.**
   - The Encoder PCB remains physically generic.
   - Encode-vs-decode behaviour is selected by the CPLD image loaded onto the board based on its
     known JTAG-chain position.
   - No local role strap, DIP switch, jumper shunt, or role-specific RC population is part of the
     active design.

4. **One common on-board BOM applies to all six Encoder PCBs.**
   - Role-specific behaviour comes from the programmed image and the off-board assembly wiring only.
   - Keyboard switches and plugboard jacks remain assembly-level differences, but the fitted Encoder
     PCB itself is standardised.

5. **Detailed Encoder logic requirements are owned in software-side CPLD logic documentation.**
   - The functional requirements for sampled debounce, 64-to-6 encoding, and 6-to-64 decoding are
     captured in `design/Software/CPLD_Logic/Encoder_Logic.md`.
   - Board-level Encoder docs remain authoritative for interfaces, BOM, and physical architecture,
     while the new logic doc becomes the implementation reference for later VHDL work.

### Rationale

- Removes a large quantity of role-specific passives from the system BOM and assembly flow.
- Gives the Encoder design more LE margin for debounce, diagnostics, and later feature growth.
- Aligns all active MAX II boards to one stocked CPLD family member.
- Preserves the single-universal-board goal without needing field-settable switches on the PCB.
- Keeps prototype tuning in programmable logic rather than freezing debounce behavior in passives
  before first-board measurement exists.

### Supersession / Obsolescence

- Any active Encoder-board wording that defines **external per-line RC debounce** as the required
  debounce mechanism is superseded by this decision.
- Any active Encoder-board wording that defines **`EPM240T100I5N`** as the required Encoder CPLD is
  superseded by this decision.
- Earlier generic-board assumptions that implied role-specific fitted passive populations are
  obsolete as active manufacturing guidance.

### Impact

- Update `design/Electronics/Encoder/Design_Spec.md` and `design/Electronics/Encoder/Board_Layout.md`
  to replace the `EPM240` / external-RC assumptions with `EPM570` / digital-debounce wording.
- Add `design/Software/CPLD_Logic/Encoder_Logic.md` as the implementation-facing logic
  requirements document for later VHDL development.
- Update BOM, board overview, power-budget, certification, and GUI-planning docs so the Encoder
  boards are counted as `EPM570` devices and no longer imply a role-specific RC population.

## DEC-042 — Encoder Port Pin 8 Carries HID-Local `ENC_ACTIVE_N`

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Category:** Electrical / Interface architecture
- **Area:** Stator ↔ Encoder connector contract, HID source selection, lightboard blanking
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Revise the 20-pin Stator ↔ Encoder connector so **pin 8** carries a generic active-low
`ENC_ACTIVE_N` sideband. The signal is used only on the HID bank:

- `J4` / `KBD_ENC` drives keyboard activity into the Stator
- the Stator source-select path chooses between physical `ENC_ACTIVE_KBD_N` and
  `CM5_KEY_ACTIVE_N`
- `J5` / `LBD_DEC` receives the selected `ENC_ACTIVE_LBD_N` so the lightboard can blank when idle

The signal is **not** propagated through the plugboard, rotor, reflector, or extension interfaces.

### Problem

The 6-bit `ENC_DATA[5:0]` path uses the entire 64-code space, so there is no spare "idle" code that
cleanly distinguishes "no key is currently active" from "a valid key code is present." Without a
separate activity indication:

- `LBD_DEC` cannot reliably blank the lightboard when the keyboard is idle
- CM5 GUI / telemetry cannot observe the selected keyboard-source activity state cleanly
- physical-keyboard and CM5-virtual key injection risk diverging in behaviour if only the data bus is
  muxed

### Decision

1. **Pin 8 on the generic 20-pin Encoder connector is reassigned to `ENC_ACTIVE_N`.**
   - Pins 2-7 remain `ENC_DATA[5:0]`.
   - Pins 8-18 shift by one position relative to the previous shield/JTAG allocation so
     `SYS_RESET_N` moves to pin 18.

2. **`ENC_ACTIVE_N` is active-low and defaults HIGH / inactive.**
   - HIGH = idle / no active HID event
   - LOW = active HID event present
   - Unused roles shall leave the signal HIGH via the MAX II weak pull-up behaviour or an equivalent
     schematic bias method.

3. **The signal is HID-local, not cipher-path-global.**
   - `KBD_ENC` drives `ENC_ACTIVE_N` to indicate a debounced keypress is active.
   - `LBD_DEC` consumes `ENC_ACTIVE_N` and must blank all outputs when the signal is HIGH.
   - Plugboard encoder / decoder roles do not use the signal in the active design and should hold or
     treat it as inactive.

4. **Physical and CM5 virtual keyboard sources must stay aligned.**
   - The Stator keyboard-source mux path must switch both the 6-bit source bus and the active-low
     activity sideband together.
   - The selected activity state must be monitored on the Stator for GUI / telemetry use.

### Rationale

- Preserves the full 64-code space without sacrificing any character value to represent idle.
- Gives the lightboard an explicit blanking control tied to real key activity.
- Keeps the extra signal local to the HID bank instead of widening the larger rotor / reflector /
  plugboard interface contract.
- Reuses spare mux and GPIO capacity already present on the Stator rather than introducing new active
  parts.

### Impact

- Update `design/Electronics/Stator/Board_Layout.md` and `design/Electronics/Stator/Design_Spec.md`
  to revise the 20-pin port pin table and document the HID-local source-select / monitoring flow.
- Update `design/Electronics/Encoder/Design_Spec.md` and
  `design/Electronics/Encoder/Board_Layout.md` to add `ENC_ACTIVE_N` to the generic module
  interface.
- Update `design/Software/CPLD_Logic/Encoder_Logic.md` so `KBD_ENC` and `LBD_DEC` define the
  required `ENC_ACTIVE_N` behaviour.

## DEC-043 — Shared Actuation Module Replaces Direct Controller Servo GPIO

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Category:** Mechanical / Electrical partitioning
- **Area:** Controller, Extension, rotor-group turnover, servo actuation
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Replace the former direct Controller-local CM5 servo path with a reusable **Actuation Module (AM)**
that is hosted both by the Controller and by each Extension. The AM accepts power and a single
active-low `ACTUATE_REQUEST` line, then performs local homing, one-shot request capture, and servo
PWM generation autonomously.

To support Extension-local actuation power without inventing a second cable family, the
Reflector / Extension harness is widened from **16-pin BHR-16-VUA** to **20-pin BHR-20-VUA** while
preserving the existing reflector-boundary service bus on pins 1-16 and adding grouped `5V_MAIN`
plus returns on pins 17-20.

### Problem

The previously active design had two incompatible actuation assumptions:

- the **Controller** used a direct CM5 `SERVO_PWM` + `SERVO_HOME` interface
- the newly agreed **Extension** turnover architecture needed a completely local request-driven
  actuator with no live Controller PWM dependency

That mismatch would have created two different servo-control circuits, two software models, and no
clean way to propagate actuation across Extension boundaries.

### Decision

1. **Adopt one shared Actuation Module PCB everywhere servo stepping is required.**
   - Controller: one AM for the main depression-bar actuation path.
   - Each Extension: one AM for group-boundary carry regeneration.

2. **The host/AM electrical contract is reduced to:**
   - grouped `5V_MAIN`, `3V3_ENIG`, `GND`
   - one active-low `ACTUATE_REQUEST`
   - no host-visible `BUSY`, `HOMED`, or fault feedback pins

3. **The AM owns local servo behaviour.**
   - power-up homing
   - home-switch reading
   - request latching / one-shot behaviour
   - servo PWM generation
   - local LED diagnostics

4. **Controller direct servo ownership is retired.**
   - CM5 GPIO 8 becomes `ACTUATE_REQUEST`
   - the former direct `SERVO_PWM` / `SERVO_HOME` Controller path is no longer active

5. **Extension boundaries regenerate carry locally.**
   - carry remains mechanical within each contiguous 5-rotor group
   - at an Extension boundary, the mechanical carry event becomes a local `ACTUATE_REQUEST`
   - the Extension-hosted AM then actuates the next rotor group's first-step mechanism

6. **Promote the Reflector / Extension link from 16-pin to 20-pin.**
   - pins 1-16: unchanged legacy service bus
   - pin 17: `5V_MAIN`
   - pin 18: `GND`
   - pin 19: `5V_MAIN`
   - pin 20: `GND`

### Rationale

- Keeps the Controller and Extension actuation hardware on the **same electrical architecture**.
- Makes the actuation subsystem field-replaceable and easier to maintain.
- Preserves the mechanical carry principle while still crossing the electrically separated Extension
  boundary cleanly.
- Avoids overloading the AM host interface with software handshakes the user does not want.
- A reviewed standalone PWM driver such as the PCA9685 is **not sufficient by itself** because the AM
  also requires autonomous homing and request sequencing; a small local controller with native PWM is
  therefore preferred.

### Impact

- Add a new `design/Electronics/Actuation_Module/` design-doc set.
- Update `Controller/Design_Spec.md` and `Software/Linux_OS/Power_Management.md` to remove the direct
  CM5 servo model.
- Update `Extension/Design_Spec.md` to host the AM and define the local group-boundary actuation role.
- Update `Stator`, `Reflector`, and `System_Architecture` docs for the widened 20-pin
  Reflector / Extension harness.
- Update the mechanical actuation docs so carry is described as mechanical-within-group and
  Extension-regenerated across group boundaries.

## DEC-044 — FDC2114 Internal Oscillator Selected (CLKIN → GND)

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Category:** Electrical / Component configuration
- **Area:** Rotor Board, capacitive position sensing, FDC2114 clock source
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

The FDC2114 on every Rotor Board uses its **internal oscillator** as the conversion clock.
The `CLKIN` pin is tied permanently to GND on the PCB. The `CHx_FIN_SEL` field in each channel's
`SETTLECOUNT` register is set to `0b10` (internal oscillator reference).

### Problem

The FDC2114 supports two clock sources: an external crystal/oscillator on CLKIN, or the internal
~43.35 MHz oscillator activated when CLKIN is tied to GND. A decision was required on which to
use for the Rotor sensing application.

### Decision

Use the FDC2114 internal oscillator (CLKIN → GND). This means:

1. No external crystal or oscillator component on the Rotor PCB.
2. `CHx_FIN_SEL = 0b10` in all active channel `SETTLECOUNT` registers.
3. Conversion reference clock frequency ≈ 43.35 MHz (internal specification).
4. CPLD I²C master (VHDL bitstream) configures this field at power-up.

### Rationale

- Avoids an external crystal BOM cost and the associated PCB footprint on a space-constrained
  circular board (Ø92mm with CPLD, FDC2114, sensor electrodes, DIP switches, and connectors).
- The internal oscillator frequency (~43.35 MHz) is well above the ~6.5 MHz nominal resonant
  frequency of the LC tank (18 µH + 33 pF), satisfying the FDC2114 requirement for the
  conversion clock to be >4× the sensor resonant frequency.
- Absolute frequency accuracy of the conversion clock is not critical for this application.
  Gray-code position detection requires only relative threshold crossing detection (presence or
  absence of an aluminium shroud slot), not absolute frequency measurement.
- Confirmed viable by TI FDC2114 datasheet §8 (internal oscillator specification) and TI
  FDC2114 application note guidance.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Reason rejected |
| :--- | :--- |
| External crystal on CLKIN | Additional BOM line, PCB footprint, and layout complexity; not needed for this sensing application |
| External clock oscillator module | Same objections as crystal; adds cost and board area |

### Impact

- Rotor Board PCB: CLKIN tied to GND; no crystal footprint required.
- CPLD VHDL: set `CHx_FIN_SEL = 0b10` in `SETTLECOUNT` register for all active channels at
  power-up initialisation.
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Design_Spec.md`: Resonant Front-End Topology subsection updated.
- `design/Software/CPLD_Logic/Rotor_Logic.md`: FDC2114 register map documents this setting.

## DEC-045 — Rotor Samtec ERM8/ERF8 Connectors Require ESD Protection

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-28
- **Category:** Electrical / ESD Protection
- **Area:** Rotor Board, ERM8/ERF8 BtB connectors
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

The Samtec ERM8/ERF8 board-to-board connectors on the Rotor Boards are designated as
requiring TVS/ESD protection, as an exception to Global_Routing_Spec.md §9, which otherwise
exempts internal BtB connectors from ESD protection requirements.

### Problem

Global_Routing_Spec.md §9 exempts Samtec ERM8/ERF8 BtB connectors from ESD protection on the
basis that they are internal board-to-board connectors. However, the Rotor Boards are hot-swappable
by design: individual rotors are inserted and removed from the live stack without tools. This makes
the ERM8/ERF8 mating faces accessible during servicing, exposing them to ESD events from operator
handling.

The Samtec connectors were originally specified for the PM/Stator interconnect (an internal,
non-hot-swappable path) — this was incorrect. They are now correctly used for rotor external
connections (between individually removable/serviceable rotor modules).

### Decision

Add TVS/ESD protection to all Samtec ERM8/ERF8 connector interfaces on the Rotor Board.
Update Global_Routing_Spec.md §9 with a servicing-access exception clause covering hot-swappable
connector families.

### Rationale

- Rotors are explicitly designed to be hot-swappable (Samtec ERM8/ERF8 rated for high mating cycles — §2.3).
- ESD events at the mating face during live insertion are a realistic threat to CPLD, FDC2114, and JTAG chain integrity.
- The relevant boundary for ESD protection is "accessible during servicing" not merely "external to the enclosure at all times."
- This is consistent with the §9 principle extended to servicing access rather than just permanent physical exposure.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Reason rejected |
| :--- | :--- |
| No ESD protection (rely on enclosure shielding) | Enclosure is open during rotor swap; ESD from operator handling is a real threat |
| Per-rotor deviation note only (no §9 update) | Modifying §9 is cleaner and prevents future designs from missing the same requirement |

### Impact

- `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md §9`: Added hot-swappable/service-accessible connector clause.
- `design/Electronics/Rotor/Design_Spec.md §6`: ESD arrays documented. Selected device: TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 (U5–U12);
  U5–U8 protect Board A connectors J1 and J3; U9–U12 protect Board B connectors J4 and J6. 8 per rotor pair × 30 = 240 system total.
  JTAG signals corrected: J1 Board A = TDI/TMS/TCK (3 lines, 1 spare); J4 Board B = TDO/TMS/TCK (3 lines, 1 spare); nTRST not routed.
  Encoder signals corrected: J3/J6 carry ENC_IN[5:0] + ENC_OUT[5:0] (12 lines) — phantom signals ENC_ACTIVE_N and ENC_CLK removed.

## DEC-046 — Bypass/Decoupling Capacitor Voltage Rating: 50V Retained on All Non-PM Boards

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2026-04-29
- **Category:** Component Selection / Passive Derating
- **Area:** All boards (Rotor, Stator, Controller, Extension, JDB, Encoder, AM, Settings Board)
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

Standard bypass and decoupling capacitors across all non-PM boards are retained at their current
50V voltage rating. No down-specification to 25V is required or warranted.

### Problem

A design review (CTL-L2) flagged that bulk reservoir caps on some boards were specified at 50V while
the highest non-PM rail is 5V_MAIN (5V). Bulk reservoir caps were subsequently down-specced to 25V
(Samsung CL21B106KAYQNNE). The question then arose: should the smaller bypass and decoupling
capacitors also be down-specced for cost savings?

### Decision

Retain 50V-rated bypass and decoupling capacitors as the approved standard across all non-PM boards.
The Power Module retains 50V for all capacitors on its input/battery path, which sees up to 16.9V.

### Rationale

**Power Module (input-side caps):** 50V is required. The PM input rail reaches ~16.9V; 50V provides
>3× voltage margin, meeting the X7R DC bias derating requirement. A 25V cap would give only 1.5×
margin — insufficient for X7R ceramics.

**All other boards (bypass/decoupling caps):** 25V is technically sufficient (5V_MAIN gives 5×
margin at 25V). However:

1. The standard approved parts (`CL05B104KB5NNNC` 100nF 0402, `C0805C105K5RACTU` 1µF 0805) are
   already approved, priced, and used consistently across every board. Changing them requires
   sourcing and approving new part numbers.
2. No existing approved 25V part matches these capacitance values — the approved 25V parts
   (`CL21B106KAYQNNE` 10µF 0805, `CL32B226KAJNNNE` 22µF 1210, etc.) are all different values used
   for bulk/reservoir purposes.
3. The 100nF 0402 bypass cap is one of the cheapest passive components in the design (~£0.002–0.003
   each at JLCPCB volumes). The cost delta between 25V and 50V variants is negligible — fractions of
   a penny per unit — and the total BOM saving across even a 500-unit build would be immaterial.
4. Consistency across the design has positive value: a single approved bypass cap part used
   everywhere reduces procurement complexity and qualification overhead.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Reason rejected |
| :--- | :--- |
| Down-spec 100nF 0402 to 25V across all boards | Requires new part approval; cost saving negligible; no existing approved 25V equivalent at this value |
| Down-spec 1µF 0805 to 25V on non-PM boards | Same reasoning; only ~10 placements total, saving immaterial |
| Mixed 25V/50V bypass depending on board | Creates two approved bypass cap standards; procurement complexity outweighs any saving |

### Impact

No document changes required. This decision records the rationale for the existing 50V specification
to prevent future reviews from re-raising it as an issue.

- `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md`: No change — existing 50V parts remain the standard.
- `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md`: No change.

### Cross-ref

## DEC-047 — OR-ing MOSFET Corrected to CSD17578Q5A

- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** 2025-07-05
- **Category:** Component Selection / Part Number Correction
- **Area:** Power Module (Q1, Q2, Q3)
- **Author:** Izzyonstage & GitHub Copilot

### Summary

The OR-ing MOSFET for the Power Module ideal-diode circuit was incorrectly specified as CSD17483F4T.
This has been corrected to **CSD17578Q5A**.

### Problem

Q1, Q2, and Q3 (LM74700-Q1 ideal-diode OR-ing MOSFETs) were listed as CSD17483F4T with a
description of "30V 10A SON-8". The local datasheet (`csd17483f4-datasheet.md`) confirmed this part
is actually a 1.5A / 260mΩ / PICOSTAR YJC 3-pin FemtoFET — completely unsuitable for an OR-ing
application handling multi-ampere input currents.

### Decision

Replace CSD17483F4T with **CSD17578Q5A** (TI NexFET N-channel MOSFET):

- V_DSS: 30V
- I_D: 25A continuous (package limited), 59A (silicon limited)
- R_DS(on): 5.9mΩ @ V_GS = 10V; 7.9mΩ @ V_GS = 4.5V
- Package: SON 5×6mm
- DigiKey: `296-48512-1-ND` | Mouser: `595-CSD17578Q5A` | JLCPCB: `C2871447`

### Rationale

CSD17578Q5A is designed specifically for point-of-load and OR-ing converter applications. Its 5.9mΩ
R_DS(on) provides extremely low conduction losses, and 25A package rating gives adequate headroom
above the expected OR-ing path current. The LM74700-Q1 gate-drive requirements (charge-pump +7V above
source) are fully compatible with this device's ±20V V_GS limit.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Reason rejected |
| :--- | :--- |
| Retain CSD17483F4T | Incorrect part — 1.5A FemtoFET cannot handle OR-ing path currents |
| Other SON-8 OR-ing MOSFETs | CSD17578Q5A already approved and datasheet verified; no need to evaluate alternatives |

### Impact

- `design/Electronics/Power_Module/Design_Spec.md`: Q1/Q2/Q3 MPN, PNs, and specs updated.
- `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md`: CSD17578Q5A row replaces CSD17483F4T.
- `design/Electronics/all_boards_bom.json`: Updated accordingly.

## QUE-001 — Exposed ENIG on Rib Clearway for GND_CHASSIS EMI Bonding

- **Status:** Closed — resolved by DEC-020 (2026-04-08)
- **Raised:** 2026-04-04
- **Area:** Power Module / All Boards — PCB Finish & EMC

### Background

The Power Module enclosure uses internal aluminium compression ribs that locate the PCB within the "Power Can".
The supercap block §4 defines a **2.0mm rib clearway** (14mm pitch, 12mm cell body) as a no-fly zone for traces on all layers.
A separate GND_CHASSIS copper pour already exists in the supercap shadow zone beneath the cells (§5).

The question is whether the rib clearway should have an **explicit solder mask opening (exposed ENIG)** on the top copper layer, connected to the GND_CHASSIS net,
so that when the PCB seats in the enclosure the aluminium ribs make direct electrical contact with the board's chassis ground.
This is a standard EMC bonding technique used in Eurocard/VME card-cage designs.

### What the change would involve

If accepted, the following updates would be made:

1. **Power Module Design_Spec.md §4** — Add bullet:
   > - **Rib Clearway ENIG Bond:** A solder mask opening (exposed ENIG) is placed in the 2.0mm rib clearway gap on the top copper layer, connected to GND_CHASSIS.
   >   Contact with the aluminium enclosure rib creates a distributed chassis ground bond at the supercap block location.

2. **Power Module Board_Layout.md** — Add keepout note:
   > Rib clearway gap: solder mask open, GND_CHASSIS copper strip, min 1.5mm wide × full rib depth.

3. **All other boards (Controller, Stator, Encoder)** — Assess whether their enclosure ribs also warrant the same treatment and add matching callouts if so.

4. **DEC-020** — Create a decision entry recording the EMC rationale, referencing the single-point GND_CHASSIS bond rule in Certification_Evidence.md §2.2.

### Considerations

| Factor | Note |
| ------ | ---- |
| Contact reliability | ENIG is ideal — hard, oxidation-resistant, consistent contact resistance |
| Enclosure material | Aluminium — no galvanic corrosion risk with ENIG |
| GND_CHASSIS topology | Single-point bond already defined (Cert_Evidence §2.2); rib contact adds distributed HF bond — compatible if star-point rule maintained for DC |
| Mechanical tolerance | Rib must be tight-fitting or spring-loaded to ensure reliable electrical contact |
| Other boards | Only applies where enclosure ribs contact the PCB — needs mechanical review per board |

### Resolution

Accepted. See DEC-020. Decision: expose ENIG on rib clearway zones, add minimum 2-mil polyimide (Kapton)
tape on supercap bodies, and add conductive elastomer gasket strip at the rib-to-PCB contact interface.
Other boards deferred pending mechanical design documentation (rib presence unconfirmed for Stator/Encoder/Rotor;
Controller noted as using 3D-printed prototype chassis with future metal chassis EMI gaskets per Mechanical_Design.md §3).

## QUE-002 — Prototype Bench-Testing Cable Strategy for Rotor Stack Connectors

- **Status:** CLOSED — 2026-04-08
- **Raised:** 2026-04-05
- **Area:** All Boards — Rotor Interface Connectors (ERF8/ERM8 0.8mm pitch) & Extension/Reflector Links

### Resolution

**Break-off PCB coupons** are to be included on the Rotor, Stator, Extension, and Reflector boards.
Each coupon is a small PCB tab attached to the main board by mousebite perforations. One coupon per
ERx8 connector. Each coupon fans out the 0.8mm pitch Samtec ERx8 pads to a standard **2.54mm pitch
shrouded IDC box header**, allowing standard ribbon cable assemblies to be used for initial bench
testing without full stack assembly.

**Coupon types required:**

| ERx8 Connector | Pins | IDC Header |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| ERM8-005 / ERF8-005 | 10 (2×5) | 2×5 IDC box header, 2.54mm pitch |
| ERM8-010 / ERF8-010 | 20 (2×10) | 2×10 IDC box header, 2.54mm pitch |
| ERM8-020 / ERF8-020 | 40 (2×20) | 2×20 IDC box header, 2.54mm pitch |

**Per-board coupon provision:**

- **Rotor:** 6 coupons — J1 (ERM8-005), J2 (ERM8-005), J3 (ERM8-010), J4 (ERF8-005), J5 (ERF8-005), J6 (ERF8-010)
- **Stator:** 4 coupons — J8 (ERM8-020) + J1/J2/J3 for Slot 1 test (ERF8-005 ×2, ERF8-010 ×1)
- **Extension:** 6 coupons — J1 (ERM8-005), J2 (ERM8-005), J3 (ERM8-010), J4 (ERF8-005), J5 (ERF8-005), J6 (ERF8-010)
- **Reflector:** 3 coupons — J1 (ERM8-005), J2 (ERM8-005), J3 (ERM8-010)

For final assembly the coupons are snapped off at the mousebite perforations and the ERx8 connectors mate
directly board-to-board. Coupon IDC connector selection (shrouded box header part numbers) and exact
PCB fanout geometry to be defined at schematic/layout phase.

Where early board concepts currently show permanent probe pads or other test-only breakout features,
that access should be reviewed for migration onto the removable coupons during schematic/layout
finalisation so the finished machine does not carry unnecessary permanent diagnostic hardware.

### Background

The rotor-to-rotor, rotor-to-Stator, and rotor-to-Reflector/Extension connections all use the Samtec
Edge-Rate ERF8/ERM8 0.8mm pitch family, which are direct board-to-board connectors with no off-the-shelf
cable assembly equivalent at standard distributors. During prototype bench testing it will not always be
practical to have all boards physically stacked.

The Extension/Reflector link (J7 on Stator, J7/J8 on Extension, J4 on Reflector) and the Encoder ports
(Stator J4-J6) use 2.54mm pitch shrouded IDC headers for which standard ribbon cable assemblies are
readily available.

### Questions to Resolve Before Prototype Build

1. **ERF8/ERM8 0.8mm pitch:** Are Samtec ERCD/ERCC cable assemblies available and stocked at DigiKey
   or Mouser for the ERF8-005 and ERF8-010 series? If not, what is the preferred bench-testing strategy
   (e.g., small bridge PCBs, short rigid extender boards, or FPC/FFC with pitch adapter)?
2. **Connector selection review:** Confirm that ERF8/ERM8 is still the correct family for the final
   design before committing to prototype PCB orders — alternative connector families may offer
   cable-assembly options without changing the electrical design.
3. **2.54mm IDC cables:** Confirm standard IDC ribbon cable lengths and sources for Stator J10
   (16-pin 2×8) and Stator J4-J9 encoder ports (20-pin 2×10).

### Note

This question was deferred to prioritise getting the connector definitions consolidated. The connector
designators and signal assignments are considered stable (pending QUE-002 resolution). If a connector
family change is required for prototype cabling, the affected documents are:
`Stator/Design_Spec.md`, `Extension/Design_Spec.md`, `Reflector/Design_Spec.md`, `Rotor/Design_Spec.md`,
`Consolidated_BOM.md`, and the Design_Log connector inventory.

## Open Work Items

The following items have been identified as future tasks. They are not yet scheduled but must not be forgotten.

### OWI-001 — Test Coupons per Board

Add test coupon footprints to each board design to simplify manufacturing test and functional verification.
Each board must be specified independently, as the relevant test signals and accessible nets will differ per board.
Diagnostic-bank style bring-up access should be relocated onto these removable coupons wherever practical,
so full prototype and service test coverage is retained without carrying extra test-only hardware into the
final assembled machine.

### OWI-002 — PAS Definitions per Board

Define Provisional Acceptance Specifications (PAS) for each board, covering:

- **Basic board testing** — power-on checks, continuity, short detection.
- **Functional testing via coupons** — using coupon connections to real external devices to verify board functionality
  end-to-end (e.g. JTAG chain continuity, signal integrity, CPLD programming verification).
- **Bring-up access strategy** — PAS definitions should prefer removable coupon-based access for
  bring-up probes, rather than requiring permanent on-board probe features in the finished product.

Each board must be specified independently.

### OWI-003 — VHDL Pseudo-Code and CPLD Configuration Plans

For each CPLD in the system, create:

- A configuration plan describing the intended logical function, I/O assignments, and state machine behaviour.
- Pseudo-code or annotated VHDL stubs ready for handoff to software development.
- Notes on how the VHDL can be exercised during PAS testing (OWI-002) to verify functional correctness.

Boards with CPLDs requiring this work: Encoder (×2), Stator (×1), Rotor (×1 per rotor, ×30 total).
