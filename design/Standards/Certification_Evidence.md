## 1. Document Scope and Purpose

This document records the design decisions and technical rationale for the Enigma-NG hardware, structured to support formal conformity assessment against the standards listed above. It serves as the
primary evidence document for any independent test laboratory or Notified Body review.

The Enigma-NG is a purpose-built digital Enigma cipher machine recreation, intended for use in museum, military, and educational environments. The device must meet CE/UKCA electromagnetic
compatibility requirements and is designed conservatively to a standard consistent with demanding operational environments. The design philosophy deliberately exceeds civilian CE/UKCA minimums to
facilitate future military compliance assessment with minimal rework.

This document is **living** — it will be updated as the design progresses through prototype, validation, and production stages. Sections referencing prototype-stage decisions will be clearly marked.

## 2. Design Philosophy and Overarching Decisions

### 2.1 "Museum-Grade" Design Standard

All components are selected and operated to a standard described internally as "Museum-Grade": the design must remain functional and maintainable for decades, in the hands of non-technical users, in
unpredictable environments. This drives the following binding design rules, applied system-wide:

| Rule | Value | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ceramic capacitor dielectric | X7R only | Y5V/Z5U exhibit >80% capacitance loss at rated voltage; unacceptable for precision filtering |
| Power capacitor voltage derating | 2.5× rated voltage | Long-term reliability under voltage stress; mandatory for military cycling environments |
| Resistor tolerance | 1% minimum; 0.1% for protection thresholds and current-sense paths | Accuracy of UVLO/OVLO/ILIM settings directly impacts protection behaviour |
| Component utilisation | ≤75% of rated maximum | Prevents thermal and electrical degradation under sustained high load |
| Thermal design | Sized for 100% utilisation dissipation | Enclosure and thermal pads sized for worst-case, not design-point |
| Switching converters | Spread-spectrum mandatory; shielded inductors required | EN 55032 Class B conducted emissions compliance |

### 2.2 Single-Point Chassis Ground Architecture

A single-point `GND_CHASSIS` bond is established between the OR-ing network output and the eFuse input — the electrical boundary between the "dirty" input side and the "clean" downstream side. All
external connector ESD protection TVS diodes shunt to `GND_CHASSIS`, which connects to the aluminium enclosure and from there to protective earth. The signal and power reference ground connects to
`GND_CHASSIS` at this one point only.

**Rationale:** Multiple chassis ground bonds create ground loops. Ground loop currents are a leading cause of common-mode radiated emissions failures (EN 55032 Class B radiated emissions) and can
exacerbate susceptibility failures (EN 55035 / IEC 61000-4-3 radiated immunity). The single-point bond is the canonical solution specified in MIL-STD-461G §3.6 and is adopted here as best practice
for CE/UKCA EMC compliance.

## 3. Power Architecture Design Rationale

### 3.1 Input Selection and Protection Chain

**Full power chain (input to output):**

```text
[PoE 802.3bt Type 4: TPS2372-4 + TPS23730 + T2 ACF Transformer (Coilcraft POE600F-12LD, 60W, 12V) / USB-C 15V PD (STUSB4500) / Battery 11–16.4V]
  → LM74700-Q1 OR-ing controller + CSD17483F4T ideal-diode FETs (×3)
  → [L1 CMC → L2 CMC] (common-mode attenuation, 1 kHz–30 MHz)
  → [L3 + C Pi-filter] (differential-mode HF bypass)
  → TCO F1 (72°C thermal fuse)
  → TPS259804ONRGE eFuse (7A ILIM via R3=210Ω, 11.0V UVLO, 16.9V OVLO silicon-fixed, VQFN 4×4mm)
  → [Dual LMQ61460-Q1 5V/12A Buck] → 5V_MAIN → [LTC3350 + 6× Abracon ADCR-T02R7SA256MB supercaps (37.5F/5.4V, 2S3P)]
  → 5V_MAIN bus
  → [CM5 via TPS25751 PD emulator] + [TPS2065C USB 1.6A] + [AP2331W HDMI 50mA] + [TPS75733KTTRG3 3V3 LDO]
  → 3V3_ENIG (all CPLDs + USB-JTAG)
```

**Input priority rationale:**

- PoE is primary as it is the highest-capacity source (72W vs 75W USB-C adapter), and in fixed installations is the most reliable and managed power source.
- USB-C is secondary as it depends on the availability of an appropriate adapter.
- Battery is tertiary as its capacity is finite.

The LM74700-Q1 + CSD17483F4T ideal-diode OR-ing provides near-zero forward voltage drop compared to Schottky diodes, minimising thermal dissipation at the input selection stage, which directly reduces
junction temperatures across the power chain and supports IEC 60068-2 thermal test compliance.

### 3.2 eFuse Settings — UVLO and OVLO Rationale

The eFuse (**TPS259804ONRGE**, 16.9V silicon-fixed OVLO, VQFN 4×4mm) is programmed via resistors (UVLO and ILIM) to the following thresholds:

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UVLO (Under-Voltage Lock-Out) | **11.0V** | Input sources: PoE ~12V nominal; USB-C 15V; Battery 11V minimum at end-of-discharge. 11V UVLO permits full battery utilisation while rejecting abnormally low inputs. |
| OVLO | **16.9V (silicon-fixed — TPS259804ONRGE)** | Highest available option on TPS25980. No external resistor required or present. Battery BMS must specify max 4.1V/cell (16.4V for 4S) to maintain 0.5V margin below OVLO rising threshold. See §3.2 Note on Battery Voltage. |
| ILIM (current limit) | **7.0A (programmed via R_ILIM)** | Maximum downstream load is 8.76A peak (see §3.5). ILIM programmed using a single external resistor per TPS25980 datasheet formula. |
| Soft-start (supercap charge) | **0.5A** | Controls inrush current during supercapacitor initial charge (~3 min from cold), preventing nuisance eFuse trips at power-on. Charge current reduced from 1A nominal to limit peak PoE utilisation to 73.9% during cold-start charge (53.2W / 72W); within the 75% rule (see §3.5). |

**Resistor ladder values (all 1% thick-film, 0603):**

| Designator | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R_UVLO_HI | 232 kΩ (ERJ-3EKF2323V — Mouser 667-ERJ-3EKF2323V / DigiKey P232KHCT-ND / JLCPCB C403086) | UVLO upper resistor |
| R_UVLO_LO | 28.7 kΩ (ERJ-3EKF2872V — Mouser 667-ERJ-3EKF2872V / DigiKey P28.7KHCT-ND / JLCPCB C403135) | UVLO lower resistor |
| R_ILIM | 210 Ω (ERJ-3EKF2100V — Mouser 667-ERJ-3EKF2100V / DigiKey P210HCT-ND / JLCPCB C403064) | ILIM set resistor (R3) — programs 7.0A trip current |

> **Note on Battery Voltage — OVLO Margin:** The TPS259804ONRGE has a silicon-fixed OVLO rising threshold of 16.9V typ (16.32V min / 17.31V max from datasheet). To maintain an engineering margin of
> ≥0.5V, the Smart Battery BMS is specified to limit charge to **4.1V/cell maximum (16.4V for a 4S pack)** — giving 0.5V margin to the 16.9V typ threshold. This specification must be enforced in
> the battery procurement specification and verified during incoming inspection. Note: the worst-case minimum OVLO rising threshold is 16.32V — only 0.32V above BMS 16.4V maximum charge voltage.
> This margin is acceptable at typical operating temperature but must be re-evaluated if the BMS charge voltage specification is ever relaxed (see §8, OA-01).
>
> **Part Selection — RON Advantage:** The TPS25980's RON of 3mΩ (typ.) was a decisive factor. At 7A, the power dissipation in the eFuse is only 0.15W (I²R = 49 × 0.003) vs 0.60W for the alternative
> TPS25948 (12.2mΩ). The 4× reduction in eFuse heat and the 4× reduction in voltage drop (21mV vs 85mV) directly reduces thermal noise injection into the 5V bus, supporting EN 55032 Class B conducted
> emissions compliance.

### 3.3 5V Buck Converters — Dual-Phase Interleaving Design Rationale

#### 3.3.1 Part Selection

Two **TI LMQ61460-Q1** (3–36V input, 6A rated, VQFN-HR (RJR) 14-pin 4×3.5mm, automotive-grade AEC-Q100) switching regulators are used in parallel, phase-interleaved.

**Why two instead of one larger regulator?**

A single 12A-class Buck regulator would satisfy the current requirement but would concentrate switching noise into one location, increase thermal density, and reduce component utilisation headroom.
The dual 6A approach provides:

- 73.0% utilisation of each IC (within the 75% rule) ✓
- Thermal load distributed across two thermal pads
- Redundant current delivery — loss of one IC degrades output to 6A (sufficient for CM5 safe shutdown)
- An upgrade path without PCB redesign: LMQ61480 (8A) or LMQ61495 (10A) are pin-compatible replacements

#### 3.3.2 Switching Frequency — 400 kHz Selection

The LMQ61460-Q1 is configurable from approximately 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz. **400 kHz** is selected for this design.

| Consideration | 400 kHz | 2.2 MHz |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AM broadcast band (525–1705 kHz) | Below band ✓ | Above band ✓ |
| Harmonic at 3× | 1.2 MHz (in band) | 6.6 MHz (clear) |
| Harmonic at 2× (with interleaving) | 800 kHz (near band) | 4.4 MHz (clear) |
| Core loss in inductors | Low | High |
| Inductor size | Larger | Smaller |
| EN 55032 Class B compliance margin | High (DRSS keeps 2× fundamental clear of 525kHz) | Requires careful harmonic management above 2MHz |
| Thermal density in Power Can | Acceptable | Higher due to core loss |

At 400 kHz with the DRSS ±5.5% modulation:

- Fundamental range: 378–422 kHz (well below the 525 kHz AM lower boundary)
- Phase-interleaved effective ripple frequency: 756–844 kHz (the second harmonic cluster, marginally entering the AM band at its upper extreme)
- This residual overlap is managed by the Iron Curtain input filter and the board-level shielded enclosure

#### 3.3.3 Phase Interleaving Architecture — 180° SYNC Implementation

**Master IC (U2A):** Frequency set by R_FSET = 86.6 kΩ (1%, 0603, ERJ-3EKF8662V, R24) from FSET pin to AGND. DRSS enabled (factory default). Internal oscillator runs at 400 kHz ± 5.5%.

**Slave IC (U2B):** FSET/SYNC pin driven by an external phase-shifted replica of U2A's switching signal, constructed as follows:

```text
U2A SW node
    │
   [R_SW: 10kΩ 1% 0402]          (isolates SW ringing from delay chain)
    │
   [C_F1: 100pF X7R 0402]         (low-pass: τ = 1µs, attenuates SW ringing)
    │
   [U_INV1: SN74LVC1G14DBVRQ1 SOT-23-5 (U13)]  (Schmitt trigger — restores clean digital signal)
    │
   [R_DLY: 82.0kΩ 1% 0402 (R26, ERJ-2RKF8202X)]  ┐
   [C_DLY: 22nF X7R 0603 (C29, CL10B223KB8WPNC)]  ┘  RC delay: τ = 1.804ms → well beyond ½ period at 400kHz (1.25µs); delay circuit relies on Schmitt-trigger threshold crossing, not τ ≈ T/2
    │
   [U_INV2: SN74LVC1G14DBVRQ1 SOT-23-5 (U14)]  (Schmitt trigger — re-squares delayed signal)
    │
  U2B FSET/SYNC
    │
   [R_PD: 10kΩ 1% 0402 to AGND]   (ensures defined state during U2A startup; U2B free-runs
                                    at ~400kHz via R_FSET resistor until SYNC locks)
```

Both SN74LVC1G14DBVRQ1 instances are powered from 3V3_ENIG (available post-LDO startup). 100nF X7R decoupling capacitors are placed within 0.5mm of each VCC pin.

**Phase accuracy:** At 400 kHz nominal, the RC delay produces a 180° offset. With DRSS modulation at ±5.5% (frequency range 378–422 kHz), the fixed RC delay introduces ±8° phase variation. The
residual asymmetric ripple at this offset error is less than 5% of the single-phase ripple amplitude — acceptable for all certification purposes.

**DRSS coherence:** Because U2B's SYNC pin tracks U2A's switching signal directly (including DRSS modulation), both ICs share coherent spread-spectrum dithering. If each IC ran independent DRSS,
inter-modulation products would appear at sum and difference frequencies, partially defeating the spread-spectrum benefit. Coherent DRSS avoids this.

#### 3.3.4 EMI Benefit Quantification

| Mechanism | Quantified Effect | Applicable Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 180° phase interleaving | Input capacitor RMS ripple current reduced by 50% | EN 55032 Class B conducted emissions (30Hz–10kHz) |
| Effective ripple at 800kHz | Output filter requirement halved; lower-inductance filter reduces parasitic emission | EN 55032 Class B conducted emissions (10kHz–10MHz) |
| DRSS ±5.5% | Peak conducted emission at switching frequency reduced ~10–15 dBµV | EN 55032 Class B conducted and radiated emissions |
| 400kHz below AM band | No interference with 525–1705kHz AM broadcast band | CISPR 25 Class 5 |
| Coherent DRSS | No inter-modulation artifacts between the two ICs | EN 55035 / IEC 61000-4-3 radiated susceptibility |

### 3.4 3V3_ENIG LDO — Selection Rationale

**Part selected: TI TPS75733KTTRG3** (fixed 3.3V output variant, TO-263 (KTT) 5-pin)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | 5V_MAIN bus | Dropout: 5V − 3.3V = 1.7V; TPS75733 Vdo ≈ 0.22V worst-case at 2.11A — well above minimum input requirement |
| Output noise | Low-noise linear LDO | CPLD VCCIO noise sensitivity; low-noise LDO mandatory vs. second switching regulator |
| PSRR | High PSRR linear LDO | Attenuates Buck output ripple (800kHz effective) — negligible at CPLD supply |
| Max output current | 3A | Peak load: 37 CPLDs × 50mA (1,850mA) + 30 rotors × FDC2114RGHR (U2+U3/U4, ~6mA typ per IC × up to 2 ICs = ~12mA per rotor) + FT232H VCCIO (10mA) + INA219 ×2 (2mA) + Controller-local (50mA) = 2,107mA → **2.11A rounded; 70.4% utilisation** ✓ (per Power_Budgets.md) |
| Package | TO-263 (KTT) 5-pin 10.16×15.24mm | Standard power package; thermal pad to PCB; no large copper pour required |
| Input power dissipation | Vdo≈0.18V × 2.11A = **~0.38W** (typ.); ≤**0.46W** worst-case | Standard TO-263 thermal pad and ground vias sufficient; ≥200mm² copper pour requirement removed |

**Why not a second switching regulator for 3V3_ENIG?**

The 37 CPLDs (6× EPM240T100I5N [Encoder] + 31× EPM570T100I5N [Rotor ×30 + Stator]) share this rail as their VCCIO (I/O voltage reference).
Any ripple or noise on this rail corrupts the logic signal thresholds, causing indeterminate switching and
potential JTAG chain errors. A linear LDO provides high PSRR isolation from Buck switching noise that no practical switching converter could match in this topology without substantial additional
filtering.

### 3.5 Component Utilisation Policy

All active components are operated at ≤75% of their rated maximum under worst-case conditions (maximum ambient temperature, maximum specified load). This provides thermal and electrical derating
consistent with military component derating standards.

**Peak load budget (5V_MAIN bus):**

| Load | Current | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raspberry Pi CM5 (full rated) | 5.00A | Linux OS undervoltage threshold: 5V/5A (25W); full allocation maintained |
| USB 3.0 (TPS2065C rated limit) | 1.60A | Single USB 3.0 port; TPS2065C current-limited |
| HDMI (AP2331W rated limit) | 0.05A | Hot-plug current spike handled by AP2331W |
| 3V3_ENIG LDO input (37 CPLDs) | 2.11A | 37 CPLDs × 50mA + FDC2114RGHR capacitive sensor ICs + other consumers = 2,107mA → 2.11A (per Power_Budgets.md); 3A LDO peak |
| **Total peak** | **8.76A** | **73.0% of 12A rated Buck output** ✓ |

**Component utilisation summary:**

| Component | Function | Rated | Peak Load | Utilisation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2× LMQ61460-Q1 | 5V Buck (combined) | 12A | 8.76A | **73.0%** ✓ |
| TPS75733KTTRG3 | 3V3_ENIG LDO | 3A | 2.11A | **70.4%** ✓ |
| TPS25980 (16.9V OVLO) | eFuse (programmed ILIM) | 7A | 4.67A* | **66.7%** ✓ |

> *eFuse load (worst case — PoE 12V bus): Supercap bank is on 5V_MAIN (LTC3350 managed). eFuse sees: total system 5V draw 8.76A + LTC3350 supercap charge 1A (5V side) = 9.76A at 5V = 48.8W. Buck
> input (÷0.87) = 56.1W. At 12V PoE bus: 56.1W / 12V = **4.67A eFuse current**. eFuse utilisation (ILIM=7A): 4.67A / 7A = **66.7%** ✓. Steady state (no supercap charge): 8.76A × 5V / (0.87 × 12V) =
> 4.20A / 7A = **60.0%** ✓. At USB-C 15V: 56.1W / 15V = 3.74A / 7A = **53.4%** ✓. All cases within the 75% derating rule.

> (LTC3350 supercap charge) = 9.26A. Buck input at 87% efficiency = 9.26A × 5V / 0.87 = 53.2W drawn from PoE source (independent of bus voltage). PoE utilisation during charge phase = 53.2W / 72W =

> Steady-state utilisation (fully charged): 8.76A × 5V / 0.87 = 50.3W / 72W = **69.9%** ✓. OA-02 resolved — see Open Actions.

### 3.6 Thermal Management Design Intent

The Power Module is housed in a 42mm aluminium "Power Can" enclosure with internal compression ribs. The thermal design provides a continuous heat path from component junctions to the enclosure:

- **Switching regulator thermal pads** → type VII epoxy-filled VIPPO via matrix (hexagonal pattern) → L4 copper plane → exposed ENIG thermal pad on PCB bottom → Gelid GP-Ultimate thermal interface

  material (15 W/mK) → aluminium enclosure wall

- **LDO thermal pad** → same via matrix → shared thermal zone with supercapacitor area
- **Enclosure** → ambient via natural convection; no forced cooling required for rated load

The thermal system is designed to manage the heat dissipation resulting from 100% component utilisation, despite the 75% operational limit, providing a safety margin for unexpected load spikes and
ambient temperature excursions consistent with IEC 60068-2 environmental test requirements.

---

## 4. EMC Design Measures

### 4.1 Conducted Emissions — Power Entry Filtering

The Power Module implements a two-stage common-mode and differential filter at the point of power entry (the "Iron Curtain"):

| Stage | Component | Type | Function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Würth Elektronik WE-CMBNC Nanocrystalline CMC | Common-mode choke | Broadband (1kHz–1GHz) common-mode noise attenuation |
| Secondary | Würth WE-CMBNC 7448031002 | High-frequency nanocrystalline CMC (replaces discontinued Laird CM5022) | Supplementary common-mode attenuation above ~10 MHz; L1+L2 pair together covers 1kHz–30MHz CM |
| Pi-filter | Moulded inductors + 50V X7R ceramic capacitors | LC Pi filter | Differential noise attenuation across Buck switching band |
| Y-capacitors | X7R ceramics, 50V, to GND_CHASSIS | Capacitive shunt to chassis | Common-mode current path to chassis; reduces conducted DM→CM conversion |

Y-capacitors are placed at the power entry point, between the power rails and GND_CHASSIS, before any switching circuitry. This ensures common-mode noise from the source is shunted to chassis before
entering the board.

### 4.2 Conducted Emissions — Switching Regulator Strategy

See §3.3 for the full dual-phase interleaving design rationale. Key measures:

- **400kHz operation:** Below AM broadcast band; avoids direct interference with 525–1705kHz
- **DRSS ±5.5%:** Mandatory for all switching regulators; spreads conducted emission peaks
- **Shielded inductors:** Mandatory for all Buck regulator output inductors; prevents magnetic field coupling to adjacent signal traces
- **Phase interleaving:** 180° offset between U2A and U2B reduces conducted ripple amplitude at all frequencies

### 4.3 Radiated Emissions — Grounding Architecture

**Single-point GND_CHASSIS bond:** As described in §2.2. The bond point is located physically between the OR-ing network and the eFuse, at the "clean/dirty" boundary. Copper pours for GND_CHASSIS and
signal GND are separated everywhere except this one point, with a clear visual gap on all PCB layers maintained in the layout.

**GND_CHASSIS ring:** A 4-layer GND_CHASSIS copper ring with 2.5mm staggered via-stitching runs the perimeter of the PCB, providing a low-impedance return path for ESD events and shielding the board
interior from external fields.

**Aluminium enclosure:** The "Power Can" enclosure acts as a Faraday shield for radiated emissions above approximately 300 MHz. All screws connecting the PCB to the enclosure pass through GND_CHASSIS
copper, maintaining shield continuity.

### 4.4 ESD Protection Coverage

All externally accessible connectors on the Power Module are protected against ESD events per IEC 61000-4-2 (contact discharge ±4kV, air discharge ±8kV minimum). TVS protection arrays shunt to
GND_CHASSIS (not signal GND) to prevent ESD injection into the signal reference.

| Interface | Protection Device | Package | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RJ45 Ethernet (MDI0/MDI1) | TPD4E05U06 (D4) | U-DFN-10 | One device per two differential pairs |
| RJ45 Ethernet (MDI2/MDI3) | TPD4E05U06 (D5) | U-DFN-10 | One device per two differential pairs |
| USB-C Power Input | TPD4E05U06 (D3) | U-DFN-10 | Covers CC1, CC2, VBUS, and SBU lines |
| Battery SMBus (SDA/SCL) | TPD2E2U06 (D2) | SOT-553 (DRL) | SMBus differential pair protection |
| Battery Presence (BATT_PRES_N) | TPD1E10B06DYARQ1 (D1) | SOD-523 | Single-line presence detect |

**Internal connections (Board-to-Board links):** Internal BtB connectors (Link-Alpha, Link-Beta) are not individually ESD-protected in the standard configuration, as they are considered internal
interfaces not subject to user contact during normal operation.

**Diagnostic test banks:** ESD protection on diagnostic banks is deferred to the post-prototype stage (see §8, deferred item DA-01).

## 5. Component Derating Evidence

All components operate within the following derating limits. Calculations are based on worst-case ambient temperature of **55°C** (IEC 60068-2 industrial maximum ambient; CE/UKCA design basis) unless
stated. The thermal enclosure is sized to handle 70°C ambient at 100% utilisation, providing additional headroom for future military certification assessment.

| Component Class | Parameter | Derating Applied | Basis |

## 6. PoE Power Budget Evidence

The following table documents the IEEE 802.3 PoE standard capabilities and the rationale for the selection of 802.3bt Type 4.

| Standard | PSE Output | PD Input Power | Input Current @15V | Pairs Used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 802.3af (PoE) | 15.4W | 12.95W | 0.86A | 2-pair |
| 802.3at (PoE+) | 30W | 25.5W | 1.70A | 2-pair |
| 802.3bt Type 3 (PoE++) | 60W | 51.0W | 3.40A | 4-pair |
| **802.3bt Type 4 (PoE++)** | **90W** | **71.3W** | **4.75A** | **4-pair** |

**Load vs. PoE standard comparison:**

| Condition | System Load | Type 3 (51W) | Type 4 (72W) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Steady-state (CM5 + USB + HDMI + LDO) | 42.5W | 83.3% ❌ | 59.0% ✓ |
| Initial supercap charge (+2.87W Buck input for 0.5A @ 5V) | 45.4W | 89.0% ❌ | 63.1% ✓ |

> Initial supercap charge (0.5A at 5V, ~3 minutes from cold start) raises total 5V_MAIN load to 9.26A (8.76A system + 0.5A LTC3350 charge).
> Buck input at 87% efficiency = 9.26A × 5V / 0.87 = 53.2W PoE input.
> Worst-case PoE utilisation during this window: 53.2W / 72W = 73.9% ✓ — within the 75% design rule.
> System must be powered for ≥3 minutes before full hold-up protection (≥21.7 seconds) is available.
> Normal minimum operational session is 30+ minutes; this constraint is not operationally significant.

**PoE PD implementation — Discrete design (TPS2372-4 + TPS23730 + T2):** The Silvertel Ag5300 / Ag53000 module (802.3at, 25.5W) previously considered is replaced by a fully discrete PoE PD design
using:

- **TPS2372-4** (TI, VQFN-20): 802.3bt Type 4 PD interface, classification, and external hotswap controller (supports up to 90W PD)
- **TPS23730** (TI, WQFN-20): Active Clamp Flyback (ACF) DC-DC controller, 200kHz, 12V output (R_VFB feedback resistors configured for 12V), PSR mode
- **T2**: **Coilcraft POE600F-12LD** — off-the-shelf 60W ACF PoE isolation transformer; 12V output, 36–72V input, 200kHz, ≥1500Vrms isolation, SMT, RoHS. Catalogue stock part ordered direct from

  Coilcraft (coilcraft.com). No custom winding required.

  - **OR-ing priority note:** PoE at 12V is lower than USB-C at 15V. The LM74700-Q1 USB-C path enable pin is driven by the TPS2372-4 `/PG` signal to enforce PoE priority when PoE is live. Battery

    path activates only if both higher-priority sources are absent.

**System capacity: 72W** (TPS2372-4 external hotswap allows TPS23730 DC-DC to operate beyond the 51W Type 3 integrated limit; confirmed by TI PMP23365 reference design at 72W/Class 8 with TPS2372-4).

**Open action OA-03 is closed** by this selection. See §8 for updated open action register.

## 7. Component Obsolescence Register

This section records components that have active end-of-life (EOL) or product change notices (PCN) at the time of design. For each such component, the design team's acceptance rationale and any
mitigation plan are documented.

### 7.1 MAX II EPM240T100I5N (CPLD — Multiple Boards)

| Attribute | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Manufacturer** | Intel (formerly Altera) |
| **Part Number** | EPM240T100I5N |
| **Family** | MAX II |
| **Function** | Encoder letter-substitution logic (6 Encoder boards only) |
| **Quantity** | 6 devices (Encoder ×6 only) |
| **EOL/PCN Status** | Active lifecycle notice issued by Intel |
| **Notice Type** | Product Discontinuation / Last-Time-Buy notification |

**Acceptance Rationale (Prototype Stage):**

The MAX II EPM240T100I5N is accepted for use in the prototype design for the following reasons:

1. **Cost effectiveness:** These devices are significantly lower in cost than their recommended successors (MAX 10, Cyclone 10 LP), making them well-suited for prototype-stage development where

   design changes are expected.

2. **Developer tooling:** The designer holds a MAX II FPGA/CPLD development board, enabling direct verification of programming chains and JTAG connectivity prior to committing to PCB fabrication.
3. **Prototype scope:** The prototype is not intended for customer-facing deployment. Obsolescence risk during the prototype phase (expected duration: 6–12 months) is considered acceptable,

   particularly given the availability of remaining stock from reputable distributors.

4. **Pin and feature compatibility:** The MAX II EPM240T100I5N in a TQFP-100 package has established tooling and documentation support in Quartus II Web Edition (perpetual free licence), minimising

   development risk.

**Mitigation Plan (Production Stage):**

Before any production units are manufactured, the CPLD selection must be reviewed. Candidate replacements include:

- **Intel MAX 10 10M02SCE144C8G** (EEPROM-based, single-supply, no external configuration memory required) — preferred drop-in successor to MAX II in terms of tooling familiarity
- **Lattice MachXO2** family (lower cost, competitive tooling, active lifecycle)
- **Lattice MachXO3** family (higher density options if needed)

Any replacement CPLD must be verified for:

- Pin-compatible TQFP-100 (or equivalent via adapter) footprint, or a PCB layout revision must be performed
- JTAG chain compatibility with the FT232H-based USB-JTAG interface
- 3.3V VCCIO (3V3_ENIG) compatibility
- Operating temperature range: −40°C to +85°C minimum (IEC 60068-2 extended industrial range; selected conservatively to support future military certification assessment)

> **Action item OA-04:** Review replacement CPLD options before prototype-to-production transition. Update this register with selected replacement part.

## 9. Future Military & Defence Certification Considerations

The following table records alignment of the current Enigma-NG Power Module design against relevant military and defence standards.
**No design changes are required at this stage.** This section is for reporting purposes and to support future MOD (UK Ministry of Defence) or equivalent certification submissions.

> **Status key:** ✅ Aligned — design meets intent; ⚠️ Partial — some requirements met, gaps identified; ❌ Not addressed; 🔵 Reference only — voltage/platform class mismatch, philosophy only

### 9.1 EMC Standards

| Standard | Relevance | Status | Aligned Features | Key Gaps / Future Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **MIL-STD-461G** | Primary EMC standard for defence equipment | ⚠️ Partial | CE102 input filter provides −46 dB @ 150 kHz; RE102 Faraday enclosure; §3.6 GND bond rule explicitly documented | CS114/RS103 susceptibility not addressed; non-PM boards lack EMC design documentation |

| **IEC 61000-4-8** | Power frequency magnetic field | ❌ Not addressed | Nanocrystalline CMC cores provide partial 50 Hz attenuation incidentally | No design intent or test plan stated |

### 9.2 Environmental Standards

| Standard | Relevance | Status | Aligned Features | Key Gaps / Future Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **MIL-STD-810H** | Environmental engineering — temperature, vibration, humidity, shock | ⚠️ Partial | Component temperature ratings: −40 °C / +125 °C for most actives; RTV silicone mechanical retention; locking connector features; X7R ceramic dielectric (stable over temperature) | Supercap rated to +85 °C — no thermal margin at upper extreme; CPLD lower limit 0 °C; no conformal coating specified; no vibration/shock profile defined |
| **DEF STAN 00-035** | Environmental testing for defence materiel | ⚠️ Partial | Same as MIL-STD-810H alignment | Same gaps; transit and storage environmental profiles not yet defined |

### 9.3 Safety Standards

| Standard | Relevance | Status | Aligned Features | Key Gaps / Future Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **MIL-STD-882E** | System safety programme requirements | ⚠️ Partial | OVLO/UVLO/ILIM protection on all inputs; thermal cutout (TCO) on battery path; 1500 Vrms galvanic isolation on PoE; graceful shutdown sequencing via supercap hold-up | No formal FMEA (Failure Mode & Effects Analysis) or SHA (System Hazard Analysis) documented |

### 9.4 Power Quality Standards

| **MIL-STD-704F** | Aircraft electric power characteristics | 🔵 Reference only | UVLO/OVLO input protection philosophy aligned with 704F intent | Voltage class mismatch: Enigma-NG operates at 11–17 V (battery/PoE), not 28 V DC mil-bus |
| **MIL-STD-1275E** | Characteristics of 28 V DC military vehicle power | 🔵 Reference only | Reverse polarity protection; UVLO floor concept | Voltage class mismatch: same as above; no 28 V bus |

### 9.5 Notes for Future Certification Submissions

1. **Platform classification (DEF STAN 59-411 / MIL-STD-461G):** The applicable test levels depend on classification (e.g., Ship Above Deck, Ground Vehicle, Airborne).
   This must be determined before any EMC pre-compliance testing.
2. **FMEA/SHA (MIL-STD-882E):** A formal Failure Mode & Effects Analysis should be conducted at PDR (Preliminary Design Review) stage prior to any MOD contract submission.
3. **Conformal coating:** Decision required at production design stage. Acrylic or silicone coating would support DEF STAN 00-035 humidity and fungal resistance requirements.
4. **Vibration profile:** No vibration specification has been defined. A target operational environment must be stated to determine whether vibration testing (MIL-STD-810H Method 514) is applicable.
5. **EFT/Surge margin calculations:** Formal margin calculations against IEC 61000-4-4 and IEC 61000-4-5 test levels should be performed at pre-compliance test stage.
6. **CPLD temperature range:** CPLD lower operating limit is 0 °C — this may require a cold-soak waiver or component substitution if sub-zero operation is required. See OA-04.
