- Conversion method: automated local extraction with pypdf and pdfplumber

## Reviewed Summary

- Exact part: Wurth Elektronik 7499111121A, WE-RJ45LAN.
- Product: single-port RJ45 connector with integrated LAN magnetics and left / right LEDs; schematic and pin numbering are included in the PDF.
- Mechanical: page 1 shows about 16.0 mm width, 21.25 mm depth, 13.5 mm body height, recommended hole pattern, and recommended panel cutout.
- Electrical snippets visible in the extracted tables include 350 uH min inductance and 1500 Vrms min insulation test voltage; page 1 also labels 1000BASE-T use.
- Pages 4-6 are mostly process / warning text; the first pages are the main source for footprint, pinout, and magnetics details.

## Extraction Notes

- Native extraction was usable, but later warning pages add noise; this summary keeps the connector-relevant information near the top.

Cautions and Warnings:
The following conditions apply to all goods within the product series of  WE-RJ45LAN of
Wurth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co. KG:
General:

* This electronic component was designed and manufactured for use in general electronic equipment.
* Wurth Elektronik must be asked for written approval (following the PPAP procedure) before incorporating the components into any
equipment in fields such as military, aerospace, aviation, nuclear control, submarine, transportation (automotive control, train control,
ship control), transportation signal, disaster prevention, medical, public information network etc. where higher safety and reliability are
especially required and/or if there is the possibility of direct damage or human injury.
* Electronic components that will be used in safety-critical or high-reliability applications, should be pre-evaluated by the customer.
* The component is designed and manufactured to be used within the datasheet specified values. If the usage and operation conditions
specified in the datasheet are not met, the wire insulation may be damaged or dissolved.
* Do not drop or impact the components, the component may be damaged.
* Wurth Elektronik products are qualified according to international standards, which are listed in each product reliability report. Wurth
Elektronik does not warrent any customer qualified product characteristics beyond Wurth Elektroniks specifications, for its validity and
sustainability over time.
* The customer is responsible for the functionality of their own products. All technical specifications for standard products also apply to
customer specific products.
Product specific:
Soldering:

* The solder profile must comply with the technical product specifications. All other profiles will void the warranty.
* All other soldering methods are at the customers own risk.
* Strong forces which may affect the coplanarity of the components electrical connection with the PCB (i.e. pins), can damage the part,
resulting in a void of the warranty.
Cleaning and Washing:

* Washing agents used during the production to clean the customer application may damage or change the characteristics of the wire
insulation, marking or plating. Washing agents may have a negative effect on the long-term functionality of the product.
* Using a brush during the cleaning process could break the wire due to its small diameter. Therefore, we do not recommend using a
brush during the PCB cleaning process.
Potting:

* If the product is potted in the costumer application, the potting material may shrink or expand during and after hardening. Shrinking
could lead to an incomplete seal, allowing contaminants into the core. Expansion could damage the components. We recommend a
manual inspection after potting to avoid these effects.
Storage Conditions:

* A storage of Wurth Elektronik products for longer than 12 months is not recommended. Within other effects, the terminals may suffer
degradation, resulting in bad solderability. Therefore, all products shall be used within the period of 12 months based on the day of
shipment.
* Do not expose the components to direct sunlight.
* The storage conditions in the original packaging are defined according to DIN EN 61760-2.
* The storage conditions stated in the original packaging apply to the storage time and not to the transportation time of the components.
Packaging

* The packaging specifications apply only to purchase orders comprising whole packaging units. If the ordered quantity exceeds or is
lower than the specified packaging unit, packaging in accordance with the packaging specifications cannot be ensured.
Handling:

* Violation of the technical product specifications such as exceeding the nominal rated current will void the warranty.
* Applying currents with audio-frequency signals may result in audible noise due to the magnetostrictive material properties.
* The temperature rise of the component must be taken into consideration. The operating temperature is comprised of ambient
temperature and temperature rise of the component.The operating temperature of the component shall not exceed the maximum
temperature specified.
These cautions and warnings comply with the state of the scientific and technical knowledge and are believed to be accurate and reliable.
However, no responsibility is assumed for inaccuracies or incompleteness.

Important Notes
The following conditions apply to all goods within the product range of Wurth Elektronik
eiSos GmbH & Co. KG:
1. General Customer Responsibility
Some goods within the product range of Wurth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co. KG contain statements regarding general suitability for certain
application areas. These statements about suitability are based on our knowledge and experience of typical requirements concerning the
areas, serve as general guidance and cannot be estimated as binding statements about the suitability for a customer application. The
responsibility for the applicability and use in a particular customer design is always solely within the authority of the customer. Due to this
fact it is up to the customer to evaluate, where appropriate to investigate and decide whether the device with the specific product
characteristics described in the product specification is valid and suitable for the respective customer application or not.
2. Customer Responsibility related to Specific, in particular Safety-Relevant Applications
It has to be clearly pointed out that the possibility of a malfunction of electronic components or failure before the end of the usual lifetime
cannot be completely eliminated in the current state of the art, even if the products are operated within the range of the specifications.
In certain customer applications requiring a very high level of safety and especially in customer applications in which the malfunction or
failure of an electronic component could endanger human life or health it must be ensured by most advanced technological aid of suitable
design of the customer application that no injury or damage is caused to third parties in the event of malfunction or failure of an electronic
component. Therefore, customer is cautioned to verify that data sheets are current before placing orders. The current data sheets can be
downloaded at www.we-online.com.
3. Best Care and Attention
Any product-specific notes, cautions and warnings must be strictly observed. Any disregard will result in the loss of warranty.
4. Customer Support for Product Specifications
Some products within the product range may contain substances which are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions in order to serve
specific technical requirements. Necessary information is available on request. In this case the field sales engineer or the internal sales
person in charge should be contacted who will be happy to support in this matter.
5. Product R&D
Due to constant product improvement product specifications may change from time to time. As a standard reporting procedure of the
Product Change Notification (PCN) according to the JEDEC-Standard inform about minor and major changes. In case of further queries
regarding the PCN, the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge should be contacted. The basic responsibility of the
customer as per Section 1 and 2 remains unaffected.
6. Product Life Cycle
Due to technical progress and economical evaluation we also reserve the right to discontinue production and delivery of products. As a
standard reporting procedure of the Product Termination Notification (PTN) according to the JEDEC-Standard we will inform at an early stage
about inevitable product discontinuance. According to this we cannot guarantee that all products within our product range will always be
available. Therefore it needs to be verified with the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge about the current product
availability expectancy before or when the product for application design-in disposal is considered. The approach named above does not
