## Reviewed Summary

- Scope: combined extraction from the Glenair `807-216` drawing-style datasheet PDF and the Glenair `Series 807 Mighty Mouse NW` catalogue / brochure PDF.
- Candidate part under review: `807-216-00ZNU6-6DY`. The catalogue lists it under **Series 807 NW Receptacles (6 socket)** with marks in the **PC Tail** and **Front Mount Jam Nut** columns.
- Drawing family: `807-216` is described as a **connector receptacle, push/pull type** using **#23 contacts**, **shell size 6**, and **15 lb pull out**.
- Insert arrangement: `6-6` = **6 #23 contacts**.
- Shell styles from the drawing: `00` = jam nut receptacle, front mount; `01` = in-line receptacle; `07` = jam nut receptacle, rear mount.
- Contact style codes from the drawing: `S` = socket solder cup, `D` = socket PC tail,
  `P` = pin solder cup, `C` = pin PC tail. Therefore the candidate suffix `DY` implies a
  **socket PC-tail** version with **Y keying**.
- Key positions documented on the drawing: `N`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`. The drawing provides alternate
  key / keyway rotation values and shows `Y` as a distinct keyed orientation.
- Review note: `Y` keying is verified as the standard battery keying for this connector family and
  is intended to prevent mating with data-only ports on standard in-service devices such as
  STAR-PAN and STAR-PAN NG.
- Catalogue positioning: Glenair markets Series 807 NW as the **"Nett Warrior Connector"**,
  calls out **NATO STANAG 4695** interoperability on the brochure cover, and describes the
  family as backward-compatible with current and legacy Nett Warrior hardware.
- Materials / finish from the brochure: shell = aluminum alloy with **ZNU plating**; contacts = copper alloy with **gold plating**; insulators = rigid dielectric; O-rings = fluorosilicone.
- Programme / ecosystem notes from the brochure: marketed for soldier power, battery charging,
  radio, PAN, STAR-PAN, and US Army / NATO Nett Warrior applications; the brochure also
  references newer 7-pin and 10-amp variants, but the candidate remains in the original
  **6-pin** receptacle family.
- Review caution: the drawing extraction contains only mechanical / ordering-code information
  plus panel cutout details; it does **not** by itself resolve the final Enigma-NG logical
  signal assignment across all six contacts. The second page of the drawing PDF appears to be a
  distributor artifact rather than part of the core Glenair drawing content.

## Extraction Notes

- Native text extraction was usable on both PDFs.
- The catalogue PDF provides programme and ordering context; the drawing PDF provides part-number breakdown and front/rear panel cutout information.
- Use the original PDFs for mechanical dimensions, cutout geometry, and any final procurement cross-check before schematic or PCB release.

	 New 10 Amp receptacles 
for higher-current soldier 
battery, radio, and PAN 
C4ISR equipment
Today’s warfighters demand quick battery charging and reliable radio operation. 
Glenair pioneered the original 6-pin Nett Warrior connector, as well as a second-
generation 7-pin series with USB-C power integration and delivery. Now Glenair is 
introducing a signature 10 Amp Crown Ring contact-equipped version for higher-
current applications that easily integrates into US / NATO, Nett Warrior, and STAR-PAN 
hub and cable systems. Contacts are capable of carrying 10 amps of current across 3 
separate channels with less than 30°C of temperature rise. Electrical resistance remains 
consistent across 2000 mating cycles. Best of all, Glenair has integrated the new 10 
Amp contact connectors into our next-generation STAR-PAN NG platform, ensuring 
intelligent, system-wide handling of warfighter electronic equipment—for both 10 
Amp-capable devices as well as lower-power legacy hardware.
Glenair STAR-PAN NG hubs and cables—now equipped with 10 Amp Crown Ring contact 
receptacles—are smart devices capable of managing next-generation high-power 
equipment as well as lower-power legacy devices.
