  - `tCx = ((CHx_RCOUNT * 16) + 4) / fREFx`
  - `fOFFSETx = CHx_OFFSET * (fREFx / 2^16)`
- The datasheet also states that the digitized output is proportional to `fSENSOR / fREF`.
- A differential-sensor capacitance equation is present in the PDF, but the mathematical formatting is partially degraded in text extraction; keep the source PDF handy for exact symbol formatting.

## Applications and Reference Design Content

- Applications called out on the front page include proximity sensing, gesture recognition, and liquid-level sensing.
- The feature-description section explains differential vs single-ended sensing, multi-channel reference-sensor use, clocking architecture, settling time, conversion time, and sensor-drive-current configuration.

3 Description
Capacitive sensing is a low-power, high-resolution
contactless sensing technique that can be applied
to a variety of applications ranging from proximity
detection and gesture recognition to remote liquid
level sensing. The sensor in a capacitive sensing
system is any metal or conductor, allowing for a highly
flexible system design.
The main challenge limiting sensitivity in capacitive
sensing applications is noise susceptibility of the
sensors. With the FDC2x1x resonant sensing
architecture, performance can be maintained even in
the presence of fluorescent light.
The FDC2x1x is a multi-channel family of
high-resolution, high-speed capacitance-to-digital
converters for implementing capacitive sensing
solutions. The devices employ an innovative narrow-
band based architecture to offer high rejection of
out of band noise while providing high resolution at
high speed. The devices support a wide excitation
frequency range, offering flexibility in system design.
A wide frequency range is especially useful for
reliable sensing of conductive liquids such as
detergent, soap, and ink.
The FDC221x is optimized for high resolution, up
to 28 bits, while the FDC211x offers a fast sample
rate of up to 13.3kSPS for easy implementation
of applications that use fast moving targets. The
large maximum input capacitance of 250nF allows
for the use of remote sensors, as well as for
tracking environmental changes over time such as
temperature and humidity.
The FDC2x1x family targets proximity sensing and
liquid level sensing applications for any type of liquids.
For non-conductive liquid level sensing applications
in the presence of interferences such as human
hands, the FDC1004 is recommended and features
integrated active shield drivers.

(1) Electrical Characteristics values apply only for factory testing conditions at the temperature
indicated. Factory testing conditions result
in very limited self-heating of the device such that TJ = TA. No guarantee of parametric performance
is indicated in the electrical tables
under conditions of internal self-heating where TJ > TA. Absolute Maximum Ratings indicate junction
temperature limits beyond which
the device can be permanently degraded, either mechanically or electrically.
(2) Register values are represented as either binary (b is the prefix to the digits), or hexadecimal
(0x is the prefix to the digits). Decimal
values have no prefix.
(3) Limits are ensured by testing, design, or statistical analysis at 25 degC. Limits over the
operating temperature range are ensured through
correlations using statistical quality control (SQC) method.

7 Detailed Description
7.1 Overview
The FDC2112, FDC2114, FDC2212, and FDC2214 are high-resolution, multichannel capacitance-to-digital
converters for implementing capacitive sensing solutions. In contrast to traditional
switched-capacitance
architectures, the FDC2112, FDC2114, FDC2212, and FDC2214 employ an L-C resonator, also known as L-C
tank, as a sensor. The narrow-band architecture allows unprecedented EMI immunity and greatly
reduced noise
floor when compared to other capacitive sensing solutions.
Using this approach, a change in capacitance of the L-C tank can be observed as a shift in the
resonant
frequency. Using this principle, the FDC is a capacitance-to-digital converter (FDC) that measures
the oscillation
frequency of an LC resonator. The device outputs a digital value that is proportional to frequency.
This frequency
measurement can be converted to an equivalent capacitance

The FDC is composed of front-end resonant circuit drivers, followed by a multiplexer that sequences
through the
active channels, connecting them to the core that measures and digitizes the sensor frequency (f
SENSOR). The
core uses a reference frequency (f REF) to measure the sensor frequency. f REF is derived from
either an internal
reference clock (oscillator), or an externally supplied clock. The digitized output for each channel
is proportional
to the ratio of fSENSOR/fREF. The I2C interface is used to support device configuration and to
transmit the digitized
frequency values to a host processor. The FDC can be placed in shutdown mode, saving current, using
the SD
pin. The INTB pin can be configured to notify the host of changes in system status.

Figure 7-3. Clocking Diagram
In Figure 7-3 , the key clocks are f IN, f REF, and f CLK. f CLK is selected from either the
internal clock source or
external clock source (CLKIN) . The frequency measurement reference clock, f REF, is derived from
the f CLK
source. TI recommends that precision applications use an external controller clock that offers the
stability and
accuracy requirements needed for the application. The internal oscillator can be used in
applications that require
low cost and do not require high precision. The f INx clock is derived from sensor frequency for a
channel x,
fSENSORx. f REFx and f INx must meet the requirements listed in Table 7-1, depending on whether f
CLK (controller
clock) is the internal or external clock.

7.3.2 Multi-Channel and Single-Channel Operation
The multi-channel package of the FDC enables the user to save board space and support flexible
system
design. For example, temperature drift can often cause a shift in component values, resulting in a
shift in
resonant frequency of the sensor. Using a second sensor as a reference provides the capability to
cancel out a
temperature shift. When operated in multi-channel mode, the FDC sequentially samples the active
channels. In
single-channel mode, the FDC samples a single channel, which is selectable. Table 7-3 shows the
registers and
values that are used to configure either multi-channel or single-channel modes.

When the FDC sequences through the channels in multi-channel mode, the dwell time interval for each
channel
is the sum of three parts:
1. sensor activation time
2. conversion time
3. channel switch delay
The sensor activation time is the amount of settling time required for the sensor oscillation to
stabilize, as shown
in Figure 7-4. The settling wait time is programmable, and TI recommends setting the wait time to a
value that is
long enough to allow stable oscillation. The settling wait time for channel x is given by:
tSx = (CHX_SETTLECOUNTx16)/fREFx (3)
Table 7-5 illustrates the registers and values for configuring the settling time for each channel.

(1) Channels 2 and 3 are available only in the FDC2114 and FDC2214.
(2) fREFx is the reference frequency configured for the channel.
The SETTLECOUNT for any channel x must satisfy:
- CHx_SETTLECOUNT > Vpk  x  fREFx  x  C  x  pi2 / (32  x  IDRIVEX) (4)
- - where
- Vpk = Peak oscillation amplitude at the programmed IDRIVE setting
- fREFx = Reference frequency for Channel x
- C = sensor capacitance including parasitic PCB capacitance
- IDRIVEX = setting programmed into the IDRIVE register in amps
- Round the result to the next highest integer (for example, if Equation 4 recommends a minimum
value of
6.08, program the register to 7 or higher).
- The conversion time represents the number of reference clock cycles used to measure the sensor
frequency
and is set by the CHx_RCOUNT register for the channel. The conversion time for any channel x is:
- tCx = (CHx_RCOUNT x 16 + 4) /fREFx (5)
- The reference count value must be chosen to support the required number of effective bits (ENOB).
For
example, if an ENOB of 13 bits is required, then a minimum conversion time of 213 = 8192 clock
cycles is
required. 8192 clock cycles correspond to a CHx_RCOUNT value of 0x0200.

(1) Channels 2 and 3 are available only for FDC2114 and FDC2214.
The typical channel switch delay time between the end of conversion and the beginning of sensor
activation of
the subsequent channel is:
Channel Switch Delay = 692ns + 5 / fref (6)
The deterministic conversion time of the FDC allows data polling at a fixed interval. For example,
if the
programmed RCOUNT setting is 512 F REF cycles and SETTLECOUNT is 128 F REF cycles, then one
conversion
takes 1.8ms (sensor-activation time) + 3.2ms (conversion time) + 0.75ms (channel-switch delay) =
16.75ms
per channel. If the FDC is configured for dual-channel operation by setting AUTOSCAN_EN = 1 and
RR_SEQUENCE = 00, then one full set of conversion results are available from the data registers
every 33.5ms.
A data ready flag (DRDY) is also available for interrupt driven system designs (see the STATUS
register
description in Register Maps).
7.3.3 Gain and Offset (FDC2112, FDC2114 Only)
The FDC2112 and FDC2114 have internal 16-bit data converters, but the standard conversion output
word width
is only 12 bits; therefore only 12 of the 16 bits are available from the data registers. By default,
the gain feature is
disabled and the DATA registers contain the 12 MSBs of the 16-bit word. However, it is possible to
shift the data

Figure 7-6. Conversion Data Output Gain
For systems in which the sensor signal variation is less than 25% of the full-scale range, the FDC
can report
conversion results with higher resolution by setting the Output Gain. The Output Gain is applied to
all device
channels. An output gain can be used to apply a 2-bit, 3-bit, or 4-bit shift to the output code for
all channels,
allowing access to the 4 LSBs of the original 16-bit result. The MSBs of the sample are shifted out
when a gain is
applied. Do not use the output gain if the MSBs of any active channel are toggling, as the MSBs for
that channel
are lost when gain is applied.
Example: If the conversion result for a channel is 0x07A3, with OUTPUT_GAIN=0x0, the reported output
code
is 0x07A. If OUTPUT_GAIN is set to 0x3 in the same condition, then the reported output code is
0x7A3. The
original 4 MSBs (0x0) are no longer accessible.

An offset value can be subtracted from each DATA value to compensate for a frequency offset or
maximize the
dynamic range of the sample data. Make sure the offset values < f SENSORx_MIN / f REFx. Otherwise,
the offset
might be so large that the offset masks the LSBs which are changing.

DRIVE_CURRENT_CH3, addr 0x21 CH3_IDRIVE [15:11] Drive current used during the settling and
conversion time for Ch. 3 . Set such that
1.2V <= sensor oscillation amplitude (pk) <=
1.8V
(1) Channels 2 and 3 are available for FDC2114 and FDC2214 only.
The CHx_IDRIVE field should be programmed such that the sensor oscillates at an amplitude between
1.2Vpk
(VSENSORMIN) and 1.8Vpk (VSENSORMAX). An IDRIVE value of 00000 corresponds to 16uA, and IDRIVE =
b11111
corresponds to 1563uA.
A high sensor current drive mode can be enabled to drive sensor coils with > 1.5mA on channel 0,
only in single
channel mode. This feature can be used when the sensor minimum recommended oscillation amplitude of
1.2V
cannot be achieved with the highest IDRIVE setting. Set the HIGH_CURRENT_DRV register bit to b1 to
enable
this mode.
7.3.5 Device Status Registers
The registers listed in Table 7-10 can be used to read device status.
Table 7-10. Status Registers
CHANNEL(1) REGISTER FIELDS [ BIT(S) ] VALUES
All STATUS, addr 0x18 12 fields are available that
contain various status bits [ 15:0 ]
Refer to Register Maps section
for a description of the individual
status bits.
All STATUS_CONFIG, addr 0x19
12 fields are available that are
used to configure status reporting
[ 15:0 ]
Refer to Register Maps section
for a description of the individual
error configuration bits.
(1) Channels 2 and 3 are available for FDC2114 and FDC2114 only.
See the STATUS and STATUS_CONFIG register description in the Register Map section. These registers
can be
configured to trigger an interrupt on the INTB pin for certain events. The following conditions must
be met:
1. The error or status register must be unmasked by enabling the appropriate register bit in the
STATUS_CONFIG register
2. The INTB function must be enabled by setting CONFIG.INTB_DIS to 0
When a bit field in the STATUS register is set, the entire STATUS register content is held until
read or until the
DATA_CHx register is read. Reading also deasserts INTB.
Interrupts are cleared by one of the following events:
1. Entering Sleep Mode
2. Power-on reset (POR)
3. Device enters Shutdown Mode (SD is asserted)
4. S/W reset
5. I2C read of the STATUS register: Reading the STATUS register clears any error status bit set in
STATUS
along with the ERR_CHAN field and deassert INTB
Setting register CONFIG.INTB_DIS to b1 disables the INTB function and holds the INTB pin high.

7.3.6 Input Deglitch Filter
The input deglitch filter suppresses EMI and ringing above the sensor frequency. The input deglitch
filter
does not impact the conversion result as long as the bandwidth is configured to be above the maximum
sensor frequency. The input deglitch filter can be configured in MUX_CONFIG.DEGLITCH register field
as
shown in Table 7-11. For optimal performance, TI recommends to select the lowest setting that
exceeds
the sensor oscillation frequency. For example, if the maximum sensor frequency is 2.0MHz, choose
MUX_CONFIG.DEGLITCH = b100 (3.3MHz).
Table 7-11. Input Deglitch Filter Register
CHANNEL(1) MUX_CONFIG.DEGLITCH (addr 0x1B) REGISTER VALUE DEGLITCH FREQUENCY
ALL 001 1MHz
ALL 100 3.3MHz
ALL 101 10MHz
ALL 011 33MHz
(1) Channels 2 and 3 are available for FDC2114 / FDC2214 only.
7.4 Device Functional Modes
7.4.1 Start-Up Mode
When the FDC powers up, the FDC enters into Sleep Mode and waits for configuration. When the device
is
configured, exit Sleep Mode by setting CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN to b0.
TI recommends to configure the FDC while in Sleep Mode. If a setting on the FDC needs to be changed,
return
the device to Sleep Mode, change the appropriate register, and then exit Sleep Mode.
7.4.2 Normal (Conversion) Mode
When operating in the normal (conversion) mode, the FDC is periodically sampling the frequency of
the
sensor(s) and generating sample outputs for the active channel(s).
7.4.3 Sleep Mode
Sleep Mode is entered by setting the CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN register field to 1. While in this mode,
the
register contents are maintained. To exit Sleep Mode, set the CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN register field to
0.
After setting CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN to b0, sensor activation for the first conversion begins after
16,384
fINT clock cycles. While in Sleep Mode the I 2C interface is functional so that register reads and
writes can be
performed. While in Sleep Mode, no conversions are performed. In addition, entering Sleep Mode
clears any
error condition and deassert the INTB pin.
7.4.4 Shutdown Mode
When the SD pin is set to high, the FDC enters Shutdown Mode. Shutdown Mode is the lowest power
state. To
exit Shutdown Mode, set the SD pin to low. Entering Shutdown Mode returns all registers to the
default states.
While in Shutdown Mode, no conversions are performed. In addition, entering Shutdown Mode clears any
error
condition and deassert the INTB pin. While the device is in Shutdown Mode, is not possible to read
to or write
from the device via the I2C interface.
7.4.4.1 Reset
The FDC can be reset by writing to RESET_DEV.RESET_DEV. Conversion stops and all register values
return
to the default values. This register bit always returns 0b when read.
7.5 Programming
The FDC device uses an I2C interface to access control and data registers.
7.5.1 I2C Interface Specifications
The FDC uses an extended start sequence with I2C for register access. The maximum speed of the I2C
interface
is 400kbps. This sequence follows the standard I 2C 7-bit target address followed by an 8-bit
pointer register byte

to set the register address. When the ADDR pin is set low, the FDC I 2C address is 0x2A; when the
ADDR pin
is set high, the FDC I 2C address is 0x2B. The ADDR pin must not change state after the FDC exits
Shutdown
Mode.

8 Application and Implementation
Note
Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,
and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI's customers are responsible for
determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their
design
implementation to confirm system functionality.
8.1 Application Information
8.1.1 Sensor Configuration
The FDC supports two sensor configurations. Both configurations use an LC tank to set the frequency
of
oscillation. A typical choice is an 18 uH shielded SMD inductor in parallel with a 33pF capacitor,
which result in
a 6.5MHz oscillation frequency. In the single-ended configuration in Figure 8-1, a conductive plate
is connected
IN0A. Together with a target object, the conductive plate forms a variable capacitor.

In the differential sensor configuration in Figure 8-2, one conductive plate is connected to IN0A,
and a second
conductive plate is connected to IN0B. Together, they form a variable capacitor. When using an
single-ended
sensor configuration, set CHx_FIN_SEL to b10 (divide by 2).

Figure 8-2. Differential Sensor Configuration
The single-ended configuration allows higher sensing range than the differential configuration for a
given
total sensor plate area. In applications in which high sensitivity at close proximity is desired,
the differential
configuration performs better than the single-ended configuration.
8.1.2 Shield
in order to minimize interference from external objects, some applications require an additional
plate which acts
as a shield. The shield can either be:
- actively driven shield: The shield is a buffered signal of the INxA pin. The signal is buffered by
an external
amplifier with a gain of 1.

- passive shield: The shield is connected to GND. Adding a passive shield decreases sensitivity of
the sensor,
but is dependent on the distance between the distance between the sensing plate and the shield.
Adjust the
distance between the sensing plate and the shield to achieve the required sensitivity
8.1.3 Power-Cycled Applications
For applications which do not require high sample rates or maximum conversion resolution, the total
active
conversion time of the FDC can be minimized to reduce power consumption. This can be done by either
by
using sleep mode or shutdown mode during times in which conversions are not required (see Device
Functional
Modes).
As an example, for an application which only needs 10 samples per second with a resolution of 16
bits can
utilize the low-power modes. The sensor requires SETTLECOUNT = 16 and IDRIVE of 01111b (0.146mA).
Given
FREF = 40MHz and RCOUNT = 4096 will provide the resolution required. This corresponds to 4096 * 16 *
10 /
40MHz  16.4ms of active conversion time per second. Start-up time and channel switch delay account
for
an additional 0.34ms. For the remainder of the time, the device can be in sleep mode: Therefore, the
average
current is 19.4ms * 3.6mA active current + 980.6ms of 35uA of sleep current, which is approximately
104.6uA of
average supply current. Sleep mode retains register settings and therefore requires less I 2C writes
to wake up
the FDC than shutdown mode.
Greater current savings can be realized by use of shutdown mode during inactive periods. In shutdown
mode,
device configuration is not retained, and so the device must be configured for each sample. For this
example,
configuring each sample takes approximately 1.2ms (13 registers * 92.5 us per register). The total
active time
is 20.6ms. The average current is 20ms * 3.6mA active current + 980ms * 2uA of shutdown current,
which is
approximately 75uA of average supply current.
8.1.4 Inductor Self-Resonant Frequency
Every inductor has a distributed parasitic capacitance, which is dependent on construction and
geometry.
At the Self-Resonant Frequency (SRF), the reactance of the inductor cancels the reactance of the
parasitic
capacitance. Above the SRF, the inductor electrically appears to be a capacitor. Because the
parasitic
capacitance is not well-controlled or stable, TI recommends that fSENSOR < 0.8  x  fSR.

8.2 Typical Application
The FDC can be used to measure liquid level in non-conductive containers. Due to very high
excitation
rate capability, the FDC is able to measure soapy water, ink, soap, and other conductive liquids.
Capacitive
sensors can be attached to the outside of the container or be located remotely from the container,
allowing for
contactless measurements.
The working principle is based on a ratiometric measurement; Figure 8-8  shows a possible system
implementation which uses three electrodes. The Level electrode provides a capacitance value
proportional
to the liquid level. The Reference Environmental electrode and the Reference Liquid electrode are
used as
references. The Reference Liquid electrode accounts for the liquid dielectric constant and the
variation, while the
Reference Environmental electrode is used to compensate for any other environmental variations that
are not
due to the liquid itself. Note that the Reference Environmental electrode and the Reference Liquid
electrode are
the same physical size (hREF).
For this application, single-ended measurements on the active channels are appropriate, as the tank
is
grounded. Use Equation to determine the liquid level from the measured capacitances:

- CRE is the capacitance of the Reference Environmental electrode,
- CRL is the capacitance of the Reference Liquid electrode,
- CLev is the current value of the capacitance measured at the Level electrode sensor,
- CLev(0) is the capacitance of the Level electrode when the container is empty, and
- hREF is the height in the desired units of the Container or Liquid Reference electrodes.
The ratio between the capacitance of the level and the reference electrodes allows simple
calculation of the
liquid level inside the container itself. Very high sensitivity values (that is, many LSB/mm) can be
obtained due
to the high resolution of the FDC2x1x, even when the sensors are located remotely from the
container. Note
that this approach assumes that the container has a uniform cross section from top to bottom, so
that each
incremental increase or decrease in the liquid represents a change in volume that is directly
related to the height
of the liquid.

8.2.2 Design Requirements
Make sure the liquid level measurement are independent of the liquid, which can be achieved using
the
3-electrode design described above. Moreover, isolate the sensor from environmental interferences
such as
a human body, other objects, or EMI.
8.2.3 Detailed Design Procedure
In capacitive sensing systems, the design of the sensor plays an important role in determining
system
performance and capabilities. In most cases the sensor is simply a metal plate that can be designed
on the
PCB.
The sensor used in this example is implemented with a two-layer PCB. On the top layer, which faces
the
tank, there are the 3 electrodes (Reference Environmental, Reference Liquid, and Level) with a
ground plane
surrounding the electrodes.

Depending on the shape of the container, the FDC can be located on the sensor PCB to minimize the
length of
the traces between the input channels and the sensors. In case the shape of the container or other
mechanical
constraints do not allow having the sensors and the FDC on the same PCB, the traces which connect
the
channels to the sensor need to be shielded with the appropriate shield.
8.2.3.1 Recommended Initial Register Configuration Values
The application requires 100SPS ( T SAMPLE = 10ms). A sensor with an 18uH inductor and a 33pF
capacitor is
used. Additional pin, trace, and wire capacitance accounts for 20pF, so the total capacitance is
53pF.
Using L and C, f SENSOR = 1/2pi(LC) = 1/2 pi(18*10-6 * 50*10 -12) = 5.15MHz. This represents the
maximum
sensor frequency. When the sensor capacitance is added, the frequency decreases.
Using a system controller clock of 40MHz applied to the CLKIN pin allows flexibility for setting the
internal clock
frequencies. The sensor coils are connected to channel 0 (IN0A and IN0B pins), channel 1 (IN1A and
IN1B
pins), and channel 2 (IN2A and IN2B pins).
After powering on the FDC, the FDC enters Sleep Mode. Program the registers as follows (example sets
registers for channel 0 only; channel 1 and channel 2 registers can use equivalent configuration):
1. Set the dividers for channel 0.
a. The sensor is in an single-ended configuration, therefore set the sensor frequency select
register to 2,
which means setting field CH0_FIN_SELto b10.
b. The design constraint for fREF0 is > 4  x  fSENSOR. To satisfy this constraint, fREF0 must be
greater than
20.6MHz, so set the reference divider to 1. This is done by setting the CH0_FREF_DIVIDER field to
0x01.
c. The combined value for Chan. 0 divider register (0x14) is 0x2001.
2. Sensor drive current: to ensure that the oscillation amplitude is between 1.2V and 1.8V, measure
the
oscillation amplitude on an oscilloscope and adjust the IDRIVE value, or use the integrated FDC GUI
feature
to determine the optimal setting. In this case, set the IDRIVE value to 15 (decimal), which results
in an
oscillation amplitude of 1.68V(pk). Set the INIT_DRIVE current field to 0x00. The combined value for
the
DRIVE_CURRENT_CH0 register (addr 0x1E) is 0x7C00.
3. Program the settling time for Channel 0 (see Multi-Channel and Single-Channel Operation).
a. CHx_SETTLECOUNT > Vpk  x  fREFx  x  C  x  pi2 / (32  x  IDRIVEX)  7.5, rounded up to 8. To
provide
margin to account for system tolerances, a higher value of 10 is chosen.
b. Program Register 0x10 to a minimum of 10.
c. The settle time is: (10 x 16)/40,000,000 = 4 us
d. The value for Chan. 0 SETTLECOUNT register (0x10) is 0x000A.
4. The channel switching delay is ~1us for fREF = 40MHz (see Multi-Channel and Single-Channel
Operation)
5. Set the conversion time by the programming the reference count for Channel 0. The budget for the
conversion time is : 1/N * (TSAMPLE - settling time - channel switching delay) = 1/3 (10,000 - 4 -
1) =
3.33ms
a. To determine the conversion time register value, use the following equation and solve for
CH0_RCOUNT: Conversion Time (tC0)= (CH0_RCOUNTx16)/fREF0.
b. This results in CH0_RCOUNT having a value of 8329 decimal (rounded down). Note that this yields
an
ENOB > 13 bits.
c. Set the CH0_RCOUNT register (0x08) to 0x2089.
6. Use the default values for the ERROR_CONFIG register (address 0x19). By default, no interrupts
are
enabled
7. Program the MUX_CONFIG register
a. Set the AUTOSCAN_EN to b1 bit to enable sequential mode
b. Set RR_SEQUENCE to b10 to enable data conversion on three channels (channel 0, channel 1, channel
2)
c. Set DEGLITCH to b101 to set the input deglitch filter bandwidth to 10MHz, the lowest setting that
exceeds the oscillation tank frequency.

d. The combined value for the MUX_CONFIG register (address 0x1B) is 0xC20D
8. Finally, program the CONFIG register as follows:
a. Set the ACTIVE_CHAN field to b00 to select channel 0.
b. Set SLEEP_MODE_EN field to b0 to enable conversion.
c. Set SENSOR_ACTIVATE_SEL = b0, for full current drive during sensor activation
d. Set the REF_CLK_SRC field to b1 to use the external clock source.
e. Set the other fields to their default values.
f. The combined value for the CONFIG register (address 0x1A) is 0x1601.

8.2.4 Application Curve
A liquid level sensor with 3 electrodes like the one shown in the schematic was connected to the
EVM. The
plot shows the capacitance measured by Level sensor at different levels of liquid in the tank. The
capacitance
of the Reference Liquid and Reference Environmental sensors have a steady value because they
experience
consistent exposure to liquid and air, while the capacitance of the level sensor (Level) increases
linearly with the
height of the liquid in the tank.

Figure 8-9. Electrode Capacitance vs Liquid Level
8.3 Best Design Practices
- Do leave a small gap between sensor plates in differential configurations. TI recommends a 2mm to
3mm
minimum separation.
- The FDC does not support hot-swapping of the sensors. Do not hot-swap sensors, for example by
using
external multiplexers.
8.4 Power Supply Recommendations
The FDC requires a voltage supply within 2.7V and 3.6V. Multilayer ceramic bypass X7R capacitors of
0.1 uF
and 1 uF between the VDD and GND pins are recommended. If the supply is located more than a few
inches
from the FDC, additional bulk capacitance can be required in addition to the ceramic bypass
capacitors. An
electrolytic capacitor with a value of 10uF is a typical choice.
The optimum placement is closest to the VDD and GND pins of the device. Take care to minimize the
loop area
formed by the bypass capacitor connection, the VDD pin, and the GND pin of the device. See Figure
8-10 and
Figure 8-10 for a layout example.
8.5 Layout
8.5.1 Layout Guidelines
- Avoid long traces to connect the sensor to the FDC. Short traces reduce parasitic capacitances
between
sensor inductor and offer higher system performance.
- Systems that require matched channel response need to have matched trace length on all active
channels.
8.5.2 Layout Example
Figure 8-10 to Figure 8-13 show the FDC2114 / FDC2214 evaluation module (EVM) layout.
