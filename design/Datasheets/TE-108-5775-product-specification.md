## Reviewed Summary

This document is the electrical and environmental Product Specification for the TE Connectivity 2.5 mm pitch battery connector family. It covers both the plug (`1-1123684-7`) and receptacle
(`1-1674231-1`) parts used in this project, and is the authoritative source for all rated electrical and environmental parameters for those parts.

**Applies to (Appendix 2):**

- `1-1123684-7` / `1123684-7` — Plug Connector, 10 positions
- `1-1674231-1` — Receptacle Connector, 10 positions

## Temperature Note — Operating Rating vs. Thermal Shock Test

The connector's continuous operating temperature is rated at **−20°C to +80°C**. However, the
thermal shock qualification test (§3.5.12) demonstrates full electrical and mechanical integrity after
cycling to **−40°C / +85°C**, which spans and slightly exceeds the DEFSTAN design target of −40°C to +80°C.

The thermal shock test is deliberately more demanding than a cold-soak storage test: it verifies material
integrity and contact resistance stability through repeated rapid temperature transitions to −40°C. The
connector passes (ΔR ≤ 20 mΩ) after five full cycles.

Continuous operation at −40°C ambient is not within the stated continuous operating specification. This
gap is documented as a note in `Certification_Evidence.md §5.1`. DEFSTAN military certification is
a nice-to-have aspiration for this project rather than a hard requirement; the primary targets are
CE / UKCA (IEC 60068-2 industrial). If DEFSTAN testing is ever formally pursued, a TE Connectivity
confirmation or written equivalence statement for −40°C continuous operation would be recommended
at that stage.
