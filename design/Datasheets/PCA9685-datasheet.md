1. General description
The PCA9685 is an I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller optimized for
Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color backlighting applications. Each LED output has its
own 12-bit resolution (4096 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller that operates
at a programmable frequency from a typical of 24 Hz to 1526 Hz with a duty cycle that is
adjustable from 0 % to 100 % to allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value.
All outputs are set to the same PWM frequency.
Each LED output can be off or on (no PWM control), or set at its individual PWM controller
value. The LED output driver is programmed to be either open-drain with a 25 mA current
sink capability at 5 V or totem pole with a 25 mA sink, 10 mA source capability at 5 V. The
PCA9685 operates with a supply voltage range of 2.3 V to 5.5 V and the inputs and
outputs are 5.5 V tolerant. LEDs can be directly connected to the LED output (up to
25 mA, 5.5 V) or controlled with external drivers and a minimum amount of discrete
components for larger current or higher voltage LEDs.
The PCA9685 is in the new Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) family. Fm+ devices offer higher
frequency (up to 1 MHz) and more densely populated bus operation (up to 4000 pF).
Although the PCA9635 and PCA9685 have many similar features, the PCA9685 has
some unique features that make it more suitable for applications such as LCD or LED
backlighting and Ambilight:
* The PCA9685 allows staggered LED output on and off times to minimize current
surges. The on and off time delay is independently programmable for each of the
16 channels. This feature is not available in PCA9635.
* The PCA9685 has 4096 steps (12-bit PWM) of individual LED brightness control. The
PCA9635 has only 256 steps (8-bit PWM).
* When multiple LED controllers are incorporated in a system, the PWM pulse widths
between multiple devices may differ if PCA9635s are used. The PCA9685 has a
programmable prescaler to adjust the PWM pulse widths of multiple devices.
* The PCA9685 has an external clock input pin that will accept user-supplied clock
(50 MHz max.) in place of the internal 25 MHz oscillator. This feature allows
synchronization of multiple devices. The PCA9635 does not have external clock input
feature.
* Like the PCA9635, PCA9685 also has a built-in oscillator for the PWM control.
However, the frequency used for PWM control in the PCA9685 is adjustable from
about 24 Hz to 1526 Hz as compared to the typical 97.6 kHz frequency of the
PCA9635. This allows the use of PCA9685 with external power supply controllers. All
bits are set at the same frequency.
* The Power-On Reset (POR) default state of LEDn output pins is LOW in the case of
PCA9685. It is HIGH for PCA9635.

NXP Semiconductors PCA9685
16-channel, 12-bit PWM Fm+ I2C-bus LED controller
The active LOW Output Enable input pin (OE) allows asynchronous control of the LED
outputs and can be used to set all the outputs to a defined I2C-bus programmable logic
state. The OE can also be used to externally pulse width modulate the outputs, which is
useful when multiple devices need to be dimmed or blinked together using software
control.
Software programmable LED All Call and three Sub Call I2C-bus addresses allow all or
defined groups of PCA9685 devices to respond to a common I2C-bus address, allowing
for example, all red LEDs to be turned on or off at the same time or marquee chasing
effect, thus minimizing I2C-bus commands. Six hardware address pins allow up to
62 devices on the same bus.
The Software Reset (SWRST) General Call allows the master to perform a reset of the
PCA9685 through the I2C-bus, identical to the Power-On Reset (POR) that initializes the
registers to their default state causing the outputs to be set LOW. This allows an easy and
quick way to reconfigure all device registers to the same condition via software.
2. Features and benefits
 16 LED drivers. Each output programmable at:
 Off
 On
 Programmable LED brightness
 Programmable LED turn-on time to help reduce EMI
 1 MHz Fast-mode Plus compatible I2C-bus interface with 30 mA high drive capability
on SDA output for driving high capacitive buses
 4096-step (12-bit) linear programmable brightness per LED output varying from fully
off (default) to maximum brightness
 LED output frequency (all LEDs) typically varies from 24 Hz to 1526 Hz (Default of 1Eh
in PRE_SCALE register results in a 200 Hz refresh rate with oscillator clock of
25 MHz.)
 Sixteen totem pole outputs (sink 25 mA and source 10 mA at 5 V) with software
programmable open-drain LED outputs selection (default at totem pole). No input
function.
 Output state change programmable on the Acknowledge or the STOP Command to
update outputs byte-by-byte or all at the same time (default to Change on STOP).
 Active LOW Output Enable (OE
) input pin. LEDn outputs programmable to logic 1,
logic 0 (default at power-up) or high-impedance when OE is HIGH.
 6 hardware address pins allow 62 PCA9685 devices to be connected to the same
I
2C-bus
 Toggling OE allows for hardware LED blinking
 4 software programmable I2C-bus addresses (one LED All Call address and three LED
Sub Call addresses) allow groups of devices to be addressed at the same time in any
combination (for example, one register used for All Call so that all the PCA9685s on
the I
2C-bus can be addressed at the same time and the second register used for three
different addresses so that 13 of all devices on the bus can be addressed at the same
time in a group). Software enable and disable for these I2C-bus address.
 Software Reset feature (SWRST General Call) allows the device to be reset through
the I
2C-bus

[1] HVQFN28 package die supply ground is connected to both V SS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must
be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board
level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad
on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the
PCB in the thermal pad region.
[2] This pin must be grounded when this feature is not used.
7. Functional description
Refer to Figure 1 Block diagram of PCA9685.
7.1 Device addresses
Following a START condition, the bus master must output the address of the slave it is
accessing.
There are a maximum of 64 possible programmable addresses using the 6 hardware
address pins. Two of these addresses, Software Reset and LED All Call, cannot be used
because their default power-up state is ON, leaving a maximum of 62 addresses. Using
other reserved addresses, as well as any other subcall address, will reduce the total
number of possible addresses even further.
7.1.1 Regular I 2C-bus slave address
The I2C-bus slave address of the PCA9685 is shown in Figure 4. To conserve power, no
internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on the hardware selectable address pins and
they must be pulled HIGH or LOW.
Remark: Using reserved I
2C-bus addresses will interfere with other devices, but only if
the devices are on the bus and/or the bus will be open to other I2C-bus systems at some
later date. In a closed system where the designer controls the address assignment these
addresses can be used since the PCA9685 treats them like any other address. The
LED All Call, Software Reset and PCA9564 or PCA9665 slave address (if on the bus) can
never be used for individual device addresses.

The last bit of the address byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1
a read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.
7.1.2 LED All Call I 2C-bus address
* Default power-up value (ALLCALLADR register): E0h or 1110 000X
* Programmable through I2C-bus (volatile programming)
* At power-up, LED All Call I2C-bus address is enabled. PCA9685 sends an ACK when
E0h (R/W = 0) or E1h (R/W = 1) is sent by the master.
See Section 7.3.7 ALLCALLADR, LED All Call I2C-bus address for more detail.
Remark: The default LED All Call I2C-bus address (E0h or 1110 000X) must not be used
as a regular I2C-bus slave address since this address is enabled at power-up. All the
PCA9685s on the I2C-bus will acknowledge the address if sent by the I2C-bus master.
7.1.3 LED Sub Call I 2C-bus addresses
* 3 different I2C-bus addresses can be used
* Default power-up values:
- SUBADR1 register: E2h or 1110 001X
- SUBADR2 register: E4h or 1110 010X
- SUBADR3 register: E8h or 1110 100X
* Programmable through I2C-bus (volatile programming)
* At power-up, Sub Call I2C-bus addresses are disabled. PCA9685 does not send an
ACK when E2h (R/W =0 )  o r  E 3 h  ( R / W= 1), E4h (R/W = 0) or E5h (R/W =1 ) ,  o r
E8h (R/W = 0) or E9h (R/W = 1) is sent by the master.
See Section 7.3.6 SUBADR1 to SUBADR3, I2C-bus subaddress 1 to 3 for more detail.
Remark: The default LED Sub Call I2C-bus addresses may be used as regular I2C-bus
slave addresses as long as they are disabled.

7.1.4 Software Reset I 2C-bus address
The address shown in Figure 5 is used when a reset of the PCA9685 needs to be
performed by the master. The Software Reset address (SWRST Call) must be used with
R/W = logic 0. If R/W = logic 1, the PCA9685 does not acknowledge the SWRST. See
Section 7.6 Software reset for more detail.

Remark: The Software Reset I2C-bus address is a reserved address and cannot be used
as a regular I2C-bus slave address or as an LED All Call or LED Sub Call address.
7.2 Control register
Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address, LED All Call address or
LED Sub Call address, the bus master will send a byte to the PCA9685, which will be
stored in the Control register.
This register is used as a pointer to determine which register will be accessed.

[1] When the Auto Increment flag is set, AI = 1, the Control register is automatically incremented after a read or write. This allows the user
to program the registers sequentially.
[2] It takes 500 s max. for the oscillator to be up and running once SLEEP bit has been set to logic 0. Timings on LEDn outputs are not
guaranteed if PWM control registers are accessed within the 500 s window. There is no start-up delay required when using the
EXTCLK pin as the PWM clock.
[3] No PWM control is possible when the oscillator is off.
[4] When the oscillator is off (Sleep mode) the LEDn outputs cannot be turned on, off or dimmed/blinked.

NXP Semiconductors PCA9685
16-channel, 12-bit PWM Fm+ I2C-bus LED controller
7.3.1.1 Restart mode
If the PCA9685 is operating and the user decides to put the chip to sleep (setting MODE1
bit 4) without stopping any of the PWM channels, the RESTART bit (MODE1 bit 7) will be
set to logic 1 at the end of the PWM refresh cycle. The contents of each PWM register are
held valid when the clock is off.
To restart all of the previously active PWM channels with a few I2C-bus cycles do the
following steps:
1. Read MODE1 register.
2. Check that bit 7 (RESTART) is a logic 1. If it is, clear bit 4 (SLEEP). Allow time for
oscillator to stabilize (500 s).
3. Write logic 1 to bit 7 of MODE1 regist er. All PWM channels will restart and the
RESTART bit will clear.
Remark: The SLEEP bit must be logic 0 for at least 500 s, before a logic 1 is written into
the RESTART bit.
Other actions that will clear the RESTART bit are:
1. Power cycle.
2. I 2C Software Reset command.
3. If the MODE2 OCH bit is logic 0, write to any PWM register then issue an I 2C-bus
STOP.
4. If the MODE2 OCH bit is logi c 1, write to all four PWM registers in any PWM channel.
Likewise, if the user does an orderly shutdown1 of all the PWM channels before setting
the SLEEP bit, the RESTART bit will be cleared. If this is done the contents of all PWM
registers are invalidated and must be reloaded before reuse.
An example of the use of the RESTART bit would be the restoring of a customers laptop
LCD backlight intensity coming out of Standby to the level it was before going into
Standby.
1. Two methods can be used to do an orderly shutdown. The fastest is  to write a logic 1 to bit 4 in register ALL_LED_OFF_H. The
other method is to write logic 1 to bit 4 in each active PWM channel LEDn_OFF_H register.

7.3.2 Mode register 2, MODE2

[1] See Section 7.7  Using the PCA9685 with and without external drivers for more details. Normal LEDs can be driven directly in either
mode. Some newer LEDs include integrated Zener diodes to limit voltage transients, reduce EMI, protect the LEDs and these must be
driven only in the open-drain mode to prevent overheating the IC. Power on reset default state of LEDn output pins is LOW.
[2] Change of the outputs at the STOP command allows synchroniz ing outputs of more than one PCA9685. Applicable to registers from
06h (LED0_ON_L) to 45h (LED15_OFF_H) only. 1 or more registers can be written, in any order, before STOP.
[3] Update on ACK requires all 4 PWM channel registers to be loaded before outputs will change on the last ACK.
[4] See Section 7.4  Active LOW output enable input for more details.
7.3.3 LED output and PWM control
The turn-on time of each LED driver output and the duty cycle of PWM can be controlled
independently using the LEDn_ON and LEDn_OFF registers.
There will be two 12-bit registers per LED output. These registers will be programmed by
the user. Both registers will hold a value from 0 to 4095. One 12-bit register will hold a
value for the ON time and the other 12-bit register will hold the value for the OFF time. The
ON and OFF times are compared with the value of a 12-bit counter that will be running
continuously from 0000h to 0FFFh (0 to 4095 decimal).
Update on ACK requires all 4 PWM channel registers to be loaded before outputs will
change on the last ACK.
The ON time, which is programmable, will be the time the LED output will be asserted and
the OFF time, which is also programmable, will be the time when the LED output will be
negated. In this way, the phase shift becomes completely programmable. The resolution
for the phase shift is
14096 of the target frequency. Table 7 lists these registers.
The following two examples illustrate how to calculate values to be loaded into these
registers.

NXP Semiconductors PCA9685
16-channel, 12-bit PWM Fm+ I2C-bus LED controller
Example 1: (assumes that the LED0 output is used and
(delay time) + (PWM duty cycle)  100 %)
Delay time = 10 %; PWM duty cycle = 20 % (LED on time = 20 %; LED off time = 80 %).
Delay time = 10 % = 409.6 ~ 410 counts = 19Ah.
Since the counter starts at 0 and ends at 4095, we will subtract 1, so delay time = 199h
counts.
LED0_ON_H = 1h; LED0_ON_L = 99h (LED start turn on after this delay count to
409)
LED on time = 20 % = 819.2 ~ 819 counts.
LED off time = 4CCh (decimal 410 + 819  1 = 1228)
LED0_OFF_H = 4h; LED0_OFF_L = CCh (LED start turn off after this count to 1228)

Example 2: (assumes that the LED4 output is used and
(delay time) + (PWM duty cycle > 100 %)
Delay time = 90 %; PWM duty cycle = 90 % (LED on time = 90 %; LED off time = 10 %).
Delay time = 90 % = 3686.4 ~ 3686 counts  1 = 3685 = E65h.
LED4_ON_H = Eh; LED4_ON_L = 65h (LED start turn on after this delay count to
3685)
LED on time = 90 % = 3686 counts.
Since the delay time and LED on period of the duty cycle is greater than 4096 counts,
the LEDn_OFF count will occur in the next frame. Therefore, 4096 is subtracted from
the LEDn_OFF count to get the correct LEDn_OFF count. See Figure 9
, Figure 10 and
Figure 11.
 LED off time = CCBh (decimal 3685 + 3686 = 7372  4096 = 3275)
LED4_OFF_H = Ch; LED4_OFF_L = CBh (LED start turn off after this count to 3275)

The LEDn_ON_H output control bit 4, when set to logic 1, causes the output to be always
ON. The turning ON of the LED is delayed by the amount in the LEDn_ON registers.
LEDn_OFF[11:0] are ignored. When this bit = 0, then the LEDn_ON and LEDn_OFF
registers are used according to their normal definition.
The LEDn_OFF_H output control bit 4, when set to logic 1, causes the output to be
always OFF. In this case the values in the LEDn_ON registers are ignored.
Remark: When all LED outputs are configured as always OFF, the prescale counter and
all associated PWM cycle timing logic are disabled. If LEDn_ON_H[4] and

frequency (default is 200 Hz)
The LEDn_ON and LEDn_OFF counts can vary from 0 to 4095. The LEDn_ON and
LEDn_OFF count registers should never be programmed with the same values.
Because the loading of the LEDn_ON and LEDn_OFF registers is via the I2C-bus, and
asynchronous to the internal oscillator, we want to ensure that we do not see any visual
artifacts of changing the ON and OFF values. This is achieved by updating the changes at
the end of the LOW cycle.
7.3.5 PWM frequency PRE_SCALE
The hardware forces a minimum value that can be loaded into the PRE_SCALE register
at 3. The PRE_SCALE register defines the frequency at which the outputs modulate. The
prescale value is determined with the formula shown in Equation1:
prescale value = round ------------- o --- s --- c --- _ --- c --- l -- o ---- c --- k ------------- -1 (1)
4096update_rate
where the update rate is the output modulation frequency required. For example, for an
output default frequency of 200Hz with an oscillator clock frequency of 25MHz:
prescale value = round ---- 2 --- 5 --- -- M ----- H ----- z ----- -1 = 30 0x1Eh (2)
4096200
The maximum PWM frequency is 1526 Hz if the PRE_SCALE register is set "0x03h".
The minimum PWM frequency is 24 Hz if the PRE_SCALE register is set "0xFFh".
The PRE_SCALE register can only be set when the SLEEP bit of MODE1 register is set to
logic1.

7.3.6 SUBADR1 to SUBADR3, I 2C-bus subaddress 1 to 3

Subaddresses are programmable through the I2C-bus. Default power-up values are E2h,
E4h, E8h, and the device(s) will not acknowledge these addresses right after power-up
(the corresponding SUBx bit in MODE1 register is equal to 0).
Once subaddresses have been programmed to their right values, SUBx bits need to be
set to logic 1 in order to have the device acknowledging these addresses (MODE1
register).
Only the 7 MSBs representing the I
2C-bus subaddress are valid. The LSB in SUBADRx
register is a read-only bit (0).
When SUBx is set to logic 1, the corresponding I2C-bus subaddress can be used during
either an I2C-bus read or write sequence.
7.3.7 ALLCALLADR, LED All Call I 2C-bus address

The LED All Call I2C-bus address allows all the PCA9685s in the bus to be programmed
at the same time (ALLCALL bit in register MODE1 must be equal to 1 (power-up default
state)). This address is programmable through the I2C-bus and can be used during either
an I2C-bus read or write sequence. The register address can also be programmed as a
Sub Call.
Only the 7 MSBs representing the All Call I2C-bus address are valid. The LSB in
ALLCALLADR register is a read-only bit (0).
If ALLCALL bit = 0, the device does not acknowledge the address programmed in register
ALLCALLADR.

7.4 Active LOW output enable input
The active LOW output enable (OE) pin, allows to enable or disable all the LED outputs at
the same time.
* When a LOW level is applied to OE pin, all the LED outputs are enabled and follow
the output state defined in the LEDn_ON and LEDn_OFF registers with the polarity
defined by INVRT bit (MODE2 register).
* When a HIGH level is applied to OE pin, all the LED outputs are programmed to the
value that is defined by OUTNE[1:0] in the MODE2 register.

The OE pin can be used as a synchronization signal to switch on/off several PCA9685
devices at the same time. This requires an external clock reference that provides blinking
period and the duty cycle.
The OE pin can also be used as an external dimming control signal. The frequency of the
external clock must be high enough not to be seen by the human eye, and the duty cycle
value determines the brightness of the LEDs.
7.5 Power-on reset
When power is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9685 in a reset
condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At this point, the reset condition is released and the
PCA9685 registers and I2C-bus state machine are initialized to their default states.
Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.

7.6 Software reset
The Software Reset Call (SWRST Call) allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to
the power-up state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed
correctly, it implies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the
bus.
The SWRST Call function is defined as the following:
1. A START command is sent by the I 2C-bus master.
2. The reserved SWRST I 2C-bus address 0000 000 with the R/W bit set to 0 (write) is
sent by the I2C-bus master.
3. The PCA9685 device(s) acknowledge(s) after seeing the General Call address
0000 0000 (00h) only. If the R/W bit is set to 1 (read), no acknowledge is returned to
the I2C-bus master.
4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends
1 byte with 1 specific value (SWRST data byte 1):
a. Byte 1 = 06h: the PCA9685 acknowledges th is value only. If byte 1 is not equal to
06h, the PCA9685 does not acknowledge it.
If more than 1 byte of data is sent, the PCA9685 does not acknowledge any more.
5. Once the correct byte (SWRST data byte 1) has been sent and correctly
acknowledged, the master sends a STOP command to end the SWRST Call: the
PCA9685 then resets to the default value (power-up value) and is ready to be
addressed again within the specified bus free time (tBUF).

The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the PCA9685 (at any time) as
a SWRST Call Abort. The PCA9685 does not initiate a reset of its registers. This
happens only when the format of the SWRST Call sequence is not correct.

7.7 Using the PCA9685 with and without external drivers
The PCA9685 LED output drivers are 5.5 V only tolerant and can sink up to 25 mA at 5 V.
If the device needs to drive LEDs to a higher voltage and/or higher current, use of an
external driver is required.
* INVRT bit (MODE2 register) can be used to keep the LED PWM control firmware the
same independently of the type of external driver. This bit allows LED output polarity
inversion/non-inversion only when OE =0 .
* OUTDRV bit (MODE2 register) allows minimizing the amount of external components
required to control the external driver (N-type or P-type device).

[1] When OE = 1, LED output state is controlled only by OUTNE[1:0] bits (MODE2 register).
[2] Correct configuration when LEDs directly  connected to the LEDn outputs (connection to VDD through current limiting resistor).
[3] Optimum configuration when external N-type (NPN, NMOS) driver used.
[4] Optimum configuration when external P-type (PNP, PMOS) driver used.

8. Characteristics of the I 2C-bus
The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
8.1 Bit transfer
One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 16).

8.1.1 START and STOP conditions
Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
condition (P) (see Figure 17).

8.2 System configuration
A device generating a message is a transmitter; a device receiving is the receiver. The
device that controls the message is the master and the devices which are controlled by
the master are the slaves (see Figure 18).

8.3 Acknowledge
The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold
time must be taken into account.
A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP

Product data sheet Rev. 4 - 16 April 2015 36 of 52
NXP Semiconductors PCA9685
16-channel, 12-bit PWM Fm+ I2C-bus LED controller
Question 1: What kind of edge rate control is there on the outputs?
* The typical edge rates depend on the output configuration, supply voltage, and the
applied load. The outputs can be configured as either open-drain NMOS or totem pole
outputs. If the customer is using the part to directly drive LEDs, they should be using it
in an open-drain NMOS, if they are concerned about the maximum ISS and ground
bounce. The edge rate control was designed primarily to slow down the turn-on of the
output device; it turns off rather quickly (~1.5 ns). In simulation, the typical turn-on
time for the open-drain NMOS was ~14 ns (VDD = 3.6 V; CL =5 0p F ;  RPU =5 0 0).
Question 2: Is ground bounce possible?
* Ground bounce is a possibility, especially if all 16 outputs are changed at full current
(25 mA each). There is a fair amount of decoupling capacitance on chip (~50 pF),
which is intended to suppress some of the ground bounce. The customer will need to
determine if additional decoupling capacitance externally placed as close as
physically possible to the device is required.
Question 3: Can I really sink 400 mA through the single ground pin on the package and
will this cause any ground bounce problem due to the PWM of the LEDs?
* Yes, you can sink 400 mA through a single ground pin on the package. Although the
package only has one ground pin, there are two ground pads on the die itself
connected to this one pin. Although some ground bounce is likely, it will not disrupt the
operation of the part and would be reduced by the external decoupling capacitance.
Question 4: I cant turn the LEDs on or off, but their registers are set properly. Why?
* Check the MODE1 register SLEEP (bit 4) setting. The bit needs to be 0 in order to
enable the clocking. If both clock sources (internal osc and EXTCLK) are turned OFF
(bit 4 = 1), the LEDs cannot be dimmed or blinked.
Question 5: Im using LEDs with integrated Zener diodes and the IC is getting very hot.
Why?
* The IC outputs can be set to either open-drain or push-pull and default to push-pull
outputs. In this application with the Zener diodes, they need to be set to open-drain
since in the push-pull architecture there is a low resistance path to GND through the
Zener and this is causing the IC to overheat.

[1] Minimum SCL clock frequency is limited by t he bus time-out feature, which resets the serial bus interface if either SDA or SCL is held LOW for a minimum of 25 ms.
Disable bus time-out feature for DC operation.
[2] t VD;ACK = time for Acknowledgement signal from SCL LOW to SDA (out) LOW.
[3] t VD;DAT = minimum time for SDA data out to be valid following SCL LOW.
[4] A master device must internally provide a hold time  of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to the VIL of the SCL signal) in order to bridge the undefined region of
SCLs falling edge.
[5] The maximum t f for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time (tf) for the SDA output stage is specified at 250 ns. This allows series
protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without exceeding the maximum specified tf.
[6] C b = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.

16. Handling information
All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 Surface mount reflow
soldering description.
17.1 Introduction to soldering
Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
densities that come with increased miniaturization.
17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
* Through-hole components
* Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
due to an increased probability of bridging.
The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
* Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
* Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
* The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
* Package placement
* Inspection and repair
* Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
17.3 Wave soldering
Key characteristics in wave soldering are:

* Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
exposed to the wave
* Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
17.4 Reflow soldering
Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
* Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 38) than a SnPb process, thus
reducing the process window
* Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
window for a mix of large and small components on one board
* Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
Table 17 and 18

Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
times.
Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
soldering, see Figure 38.
