**Important variant distinction:**

| Variant | VCCINT Supply | Internal Core Regulation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| EPM570 (standard, **our part**) | 3.3 V or 2.5 V external | On-chip LDO generates 1.8 V core internally |
| EPM570**G** (Green/low-power) | 1.8 V external only | External supply drives core directly — no internal LDO |
| EPM570**Z** (ultra-low-power) | 1.8 V external only | External supply drives core directly — no internal LDO |

> **If the part number does not include the G or Z suffix, it is the standard variant and
> requires a 3.3 V or 2.5 V VCCINT supply. No external 1.8 V rail is needed.**

## Power Supply Requirements

### Absolute Maximum Ratings (from Table 5-1 of handbook)

| Symbol | Parameter | Min | Max | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| VCCINT | Internal supply voltage | −0.5 | 4.6 | V |
| VCCIO | I/O supply voltage | −0.5 | 4.6 | V |
| VI | DC input voltage | −0.5 | 4.6 | V |
| IOUT | DC output current per pin | −25 | 25 | mA |
| TJ | Junction temperature (under bias) | — | 135 | °C |

### Recommended Operating Conditions (from Table 5-2 of handbook)

| Symbol | Parameter | Min | Nom | Max | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| VCCINT | 3.3 V supply for internal logic and ISP | 3.00 | 3.3 | 3.60 | V |
| VCCINT | 2.5 V supply for internal logic and ISP | 2.375 | 2.5 | 2.625 | V |
| VCCIO | I/O supply — 3.3 V operation | 3.00 | 3.3 | 3.60 | V |
| VCCIO | I/O supply — 2.5 V operation | 2.375 | 2.5 | 2.625 | V |
| VCCIO | I/O supply — 1.8 V operation | 1.71 | 1.8 | 1.89 | V |
| VCCIO | I/O supply — 1.5 V operation | 1.425 | 1.5 | 1.575 | V |
| TJ | Junction temperature (industrial) | −40 | — | 100 | °C |

> **Note:** The voltage regulator is not guaranteed for VCCINT values between the 2.5 V
> maximum and the 3.3 V minimum (i.e. approximately 2.625 V to 3.00 V). Do not operate
> VCCINT in this intermediate range.

### MultiVolt Core Architecture

The standard MAX II device (EPM570, not G/Z) integrates an **on-chip linear voltage regulator**
that accepts 3.3 V or 2.5 V on the VCCINT pins and regulates the supply down to an internal
1.8 V core voltage. This is transparent to the board designer — **no external 1.8 V rail is
required** when powering VCCINT from a 3.3 V supply.

The VCCIO pins are independent and can be set to 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V, or 3.3 V to match
the I/O voltage standard of each I/O bank. Multiple VCCIO voltages can be used simultaneously
across different banks.

## Application in This Design

In the Enigma-NG project:

- VCCINT is connected to `3V3_ENIG` (3.3 V).
- VCCIO is connected to `3V3_ENIG` (3.3 V), giving LVTTL/LVCMOS 3.3 V I/O on all banks.
- No external 1.8 V supply is present or required.
- This part is used on: **Stator Board** (U1) and **Encoder Board** (U1).

## Package Information

- Package: 100-pin Plastic Thin Quad Flat Pack (TQFP)
