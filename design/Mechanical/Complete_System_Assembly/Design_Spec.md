## Overview

This is the top-level General Assembly document for the Enigma-NG machine. It defines the complete
set of mechanical and electromechanical components that constitute the finished machine and provides
the authoritative assembly sequence guidance for build and maintenance activities.

All sub-assembly details, tolerances, and part-level instructions are contained in the
sub-assembly documents listed in §3. This document provides the integration view: what assembles
where, in what order, and with what dependencies.

## Assembly Sequence Overview

The following is the recommended assembly order for a complete machine build. Sub-assembly build
steps are detailed in each referenced document; this section defines integration dependencies only.

| Step | Sub-Assembly | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Power Module | Standalone build; test on bench before integration. Delivers 5V_MAIN and 3V3_ENIG. |
| 2 | Stator Board | Install ICs (CPLD, MCP23017 ×3, INA219), passives, connectors. Bench-test I²C expanders before stack assembly. |
| 3 | Rotors (×30) | Build all 30 rotor modules. Verify ERM8 header alignment and encoder slot clearance before stacking. |
| 4 | Rotor groups onto Stator | Press Rotor 1 ERM8 headers into Stator ERF8 sockets. Build the first 5-rotor group, then insert an Extension before each further 5-rotor group as required. Verify JTAG daisy-chain continuity at each group boundary. |
| 5 | Rotor Actuation Assembly | Install depression bar, pivot lever, actuation arm, sprung retention bar. Fit the Controller-local Actuation Module and connect its servo and home-switch looms. |
| 6 | Keyboard Assembly | Build keyboard panel + `KBD_ENC` Encoder Module. Connect IDC ribbon to the Stator keyboard encoder port. |
| 7 | Lightboard Assembly | Build lightboard panel + `LBD_DEC` Encoder Module. Connect IDC ribbon to the Stator lightboard decoder port. |
| 8 | Plugboard Assembly | Build both plugboard passes. Connect IDC ribbons to the four Stator plugboard ports (`PLG_PASS1_DEC`, `PLG_PASS1_ENC`, `PLG_PASS2_DEC`, `PLG_PASS2_ENC`). |
| 9 | Reflector | Install the mandatory passive Reflector sub-assembly at the far end of the final rotor group. Connect the 20-pin cable to Stator J10. Reflection-map selection remains Stator-CPLD-owned. |
| 10 | Extension (if used) | Insert each Extension between 5-rotor groups: `Stator -> 5 rotors -> [Extension -> 5 rotors]* -> Reflector`. Each Extension reinjects clean `3V3_ENIG`, carries the reflector-boundary service harness including grouped `5V_MAIN`, and hosts one local Actuation Module for the next group-boundary carry handoff. |
| 11 | Controller Board + JDB Hat | Install JDB hat on Controller. Mount Controller in Main Enclosure. Engage the TE PM dock cluster (`J1/J2/J3`) to the Power Module, then mate the Molex Stator dock pair (`J4/J5` ↔ `J11/J12`). |
| 12 | Settings Board | Mount Settings Board PCB to Main Enclosure right side top panel. Route the 6-wire harness (`3V3_ENIG`, `5V_MAIN`, `GND`, `SDA`, `SCL`, `GND`) to Stator J13. Verify `U1`, `U2`, and `U3` appear on the shared I²C bus, then run a functional check that reads switch-state changes and drives each bank's RGB indicator rails before final panel closure. |
| 13 | Main Enclosure final assembly | Route all cable harnesses. Install panels. Fit fan. Secure EMI bonding. Final torque fasteners. |

> **Note on the JTAG Daughterboard (JDB):** The JDB is a PCB hat that mounts directly on the
> Controller Board. It has no independent mechanical assembly step — it is installed as part of
> Step 10 (Controller Board install) before the Controller is fitted in the Main Enclosure.
> See `design/Electronics/JTAG_Daughterboard/Design_Spec.md` for electrical details.
