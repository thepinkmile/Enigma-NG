## 1. Overview

The Enigma-NG rotor is a split two-board assembly consisting of Board A (input side) and
Board B (output side), both circular PCBs (Ø92mm), housed inside an aluminium shroud (Ø100mm
outer diameter). The shroud is the outer rotating element; the PCB/chassis assembly is the
static inner hub.

Total outer diameter matches the original Enigma machine (~100mm) for authentic proportions.

> pinouts, BOM, FR/DR requirements), see
> `design/Electronics/Rotor/Design_Spec.md`.

## 3. Manufacturing Tolerances

All mechanical parts must be manufactured to the tolerances specified below.

| Feature | Nominal | Tolerance | Standard / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Shroud outer diameter | Ø100mm | ±0.1mm | CNC machined aluminium |
| Shroud inner bore (PCB fit) | Ø92mm | H7 (+0.000/+0.035mm) | Clearance fit for rotation |
| Shroud wall thickness | 4mm | ±0.1mm | CNC machined |
| PCB outer diameter | Ø92mm | ±0.2mm | JLCPCB PCB fabrication |
| PCB thickness | 1.6mm | ±0.1mm | PCB fabrication standard |
| Board gap | ~11.8mm | ±0.5mm | IDC connector + PCB thickness stack |
| Capacitive sensor gap (PCB face to shroud flange) | 0.5mm | ±0.15mm | Controlled by bearing precision — critical for FDC2114 sensor reliability |
| Gray code slot angular position | — | ±0.1° | CNC milled, per-slot angular tolerance |
| Gray code slot depth | 0.5mm | ±0.05mm | Milled into shroud flange inner face |
| Character engraving depth | 0.4mm | ±0.1mm | Milled on shroud outer cylindrical face |
| Character engraving width | per-character | ±0.1mm | CNC |
| Rolling element diameter | TBD | ±0.01mm | Matched set required for even load |

> **Note on capacitive gap:** The FDC2114RGHR sensor sensitivity must be validated across the
> full tolerance range (0.35mm minimum to 0.65mm maximum gap). Bearing precision directly
> determines sensor reliability.

## 4. Shroud Design

* **Material:** Aluminium alloy (grade TBD — suggest 6061-T6 for machinability and surface finish)
* **Manufacturing:** CNC machined
* **Style:** Dish-shaped outer shell. Board A PCB and chassis mount inside the dish. A cover
  plate (Board B side) screws down from the Board B side.
* **Bearing mechanism:** Rolling-pin style cylindrical bearings around the inner circumference
  of the shroud. Bearing pockets machined into the shroud inner wall.
* **Rolling elements:** Must use ceramic or nylon rolling elements — **electrically isolating
  required**. The aluminium shroud must remain electrically floating relative to PCB ground.
  Metal rolling elements must NOT be used.
* **Outer face:** Characters engraved on the outer cylindrical face at r=50mm. Engraving depth
  0.4mm ±0.1mm. Character height/width to suit per-segment arc width (N=26: 12.08mm arc;
  N=64: 4.91mm arc at r=50mm).
* **Inner flanges (brake-caliper style):** The shroud flanges extend over both PCB flat faces.
  The inner face of each flange carries the Gray code encoder slot pattern (see §5).
* **Electrical isolation:** The shroud must remain floating. Do not ground the shroud to the
  PCB or chassis. Specify this explicitly on assembly drawings.

## 5. Capacitive Encoder Slot Patterns

The Gray code encoder pattern is machined as slots/pockets into the inner face of the shroud
flanges. No electronic components are present on the shroud.

**Sensing principle:** Solid aluminium over a sensor electrode = high capacitance; milled slot
(air) = low capacitance. The FDC2114RGHR on the PCB measures these changes as the shroud
rotates.

**Sensor electrode radius:** r=44mm on the PCB flat face (bare copper electrode pads, no
components).

### 5.1 N=64 Rotor (dual-track)

* **Track A** (bits[5:3]): milled into inner face of shroud **dish** (Board A side flange)
* **Track B** (bits[2:0]): milled into inner face of shroud **cover** (Board B side flange)
* 3 sensor electrodes per track (6 total, 3 per PCB)
* Encoding: standard 6-bit reflected (binary) Gray code — perfect Gray code, zero multi-bit
  transitions including wrap-around
* Arc per segment at r=44mm: 4.32mm

> patterns.

### 5.2 N=26 Rotor (single-track, Board A only)

* **Track A** (5-bit STGC): milled into inner face of shroud **dish** (Board A side flange)
  only
* Board B side flange: no encoder slots (plain inner face)
* 5 sensor electrodes on Board A only (4 read by U2, addr 0x2A, STGC bits[3:0]; 1 read by U3,
  addr 0x2B, STGC bit[4]; both FDC2114RGHR ICs on Board A)
* Encoding: Single-Track Gray Code (STGC) — nearest achievable to Gray code for N=26
  (non-power-of-2)
* Arc per segment at r=44mm: 10.63mm

> **Cross-reference:** `design/Electronics/Rotor/Rotor_26_Char_Design.md §7` for track
> pattern.

## 6. Internal Header Assembly

* **Connector type:** Four single-row 2.54mm THT pin headers (H_SW3: Adam Tech PH1-07-UA 1×7;
  H_PWR: Adam Tech RS1-05-G 1×5 or PH1-05-UA 1×5; H_JTAG: same as H_PWR; H_SENS: same as
  H_PWR inverse gender). Mixed gender provides physical keying.
* **Keying:** Board A carries H_SW3/H_SENS as male and H_PWR/H_JTAG as female; Board B carries
  the inverse. The unique 7-pin footprint of H_SW3 makes incorrect board orientation geometrically
  impossible.
* **Assembly sequence:**
  1. JLCPCB SMT pick-and-place assembly is performed on the outward-facing side of each board
     (Board A and Board B separately).
  2. After JLCPCB assembly, all four headers are **manually soldered** to the inner-facing
     side of each board.
  3. The two boards are then mated via the four headers and secured within the shroud dish.
  4. The shroud cover is fitted and secured.
* **Mated height:** ~8.5mm (fits within 11.8mm board gap; 3.3mm clearance)

> **Cross-reference:** `design/Electronics/Rotor/Design_Spec.md §3.4` for full signal
> pinout of all four headers.

| Board B inner face | 8.5mm (IDC only) | IDC header + mating header height |
