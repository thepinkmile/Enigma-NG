# Checkpoint 165 — PM Pass-10 All Resolved; ROT Progress

**Date:** 2026-05-19  
**Session focus:** Pass-10 findings resolution — Power Module complete; Rotor progress

## Work Done This Session

### Power Module — Pass 10 now 10/10 resolved ✅

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PM-P10-10 | Review report stale notes corrected ("R23→R16" error removed); marked ✅ RESOLVED |
| PM-P10-02 | §3.1 SW2 block in Design_Spec extended with explicit U16/U17 named cross-ref; marked ✅ RESOLVED |
| PM-P10-06 | D4 TVS §2.6 bullet confirmed already present; marked ✅ RESOLVED (stale partial) |
| PM-P10-08 | DR-PM-14 C57/C58 exclusion confirmed already applied; marked ✅ RESOLVED (stale partial) |

PM P10 tally corrected from stale value to: **10 resolved ✅, 0 partial ⚠️, 0 open ❌**

### DEC-073 violation fix

DEC-073 in `design/Design_Log.md` contained a wrong MPN committed by a prior agent violation:
- Line: "ERA-2AEB1333X (133 kΩ, same series, same footprint)" — **ERA-2AEB1333X is a 13kΩ part, not 133kΩ**
- Fixed to: `ERJ-PC3B1333V (133 kΩ, Panasonic ERJ-PC3, 0.1% thick-film, 0603)`
- Package note corrected: `0402 thin-film` → `0603 thick-film — footprint change from 0402 required`
- Design_Spec and Consolidated_BOM were already correct (ERJ-PC3B1333V); DEC-073 is now consistent

### Rotor — Pass 10 progress

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ROT-P10-10 | GRS §6 reference + board label confirmed in Design_Spec §7; marked ✅ RESOLVED |
| ROT-P10-11 | GRS §7.1 pin-1 marker callouts confirmed in Board_Layout for both boards; marked ✅ RESOLVED |
| ROT-P10-12 | Confirmed already resolved: Design_Spec line 455 cites "Samtec ERM8-005 datasheet: 1.0 A/pin rated; 0.5 A/pin de-rated in this design" — **needs review report update next session** |

ROT P10 tally corrected from stale 8/1/6 to: **13 resolved ✅, 0 partial ⚠️, 2 open ❌**  
(ROT-P10-12 will become 14/0/1 once review report updated next session)

---

## Files Modified This Session

- `design/Design_Log.md` — DEC-073 MPN + package corrected (violation fix)
- `design/Electronics/Power_Module/Design_Spec.md` — §3.1 SW2 block: U16/U17 named cross-ref added
- `.copilot/review-report.md` — PM-P10-10/02/06/08 resolved; ROT-P10-10/11 resolved; tallies corrected

---

## Immediate Next Action (on return)

**ROT-P10-12** — Mark ✅ RESOLVED in review report (no file change needed; citation already exists at Design_Spec line 455). Then proceed to:

**ROT-P10-15** (MINOR, genuinely open) — `Rotor_64_Char_Design.md §8 BOM` lists `C22B–C25B` / `L5B–L8B` for the N=64 U2 CH3 dummy LC tanks, but there is no explicit channel-to-RefDes mapping for U2 CH3 or U11B in that file. Needs investigation of the current document state before deciding on a fix.

After ROT: CTL partials (CTL-P10-12, CTL-P10-13), then ENC, EXT, AM, USM, JM, STA findings.

## Key Technical Facts

- **R23 correct MPN:** `ERJ-PC3B1333V` (Panasonic ERJ-PC3, 133kΩ, 0.1%, ±25PPM/°C, 0603 thick-film)
- **DEC-073** now records correct MPN and package; ERA-2AEB1333X was the wrong part
- **U16 = SN74LVC1G175DBVR** (D-FF, SOT-23-6); **U17 = SN74LVC1G08DBVR** (AND gate, SOT-23-5)
  Shutdown latch: clocked by PWR_BUT_N while CM5_PWR_ON HIGH; cleared by LED_PWR_N deassert
- **Next checkpoint = 165; Next DEC = DEC-082**
- **data-plate-standardisation** todo is a hard dependency of `review-pass-11`; format = `GERMAN [English] Vx.y` (no AUSGABE prefix)

## Standing Rules Reminder

- NEVER commit without "Let's lock this in" or "Save state" from user in live session
- Design_Log.md is append-only — DEC-073 fix was a permitted violation correction
- NEVER modify MPNs or supplier PNs without explicit user confirmation
- Move unwanted files to `.recycle-bin/`; never delete
- Last Updated must be updated on every content change; Version is user-only
- OCTONARY: Seed session DB from `todo-list.md` Agent SQL block as MANDATORY FIRST ACTION
