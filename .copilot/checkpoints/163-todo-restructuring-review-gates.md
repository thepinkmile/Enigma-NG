# Checkpoint 163 — Todo restructuring and review-pass gate

**Date:** 2026-05-17  
**Session work:** Todo dependency restructuring; new review-clean-passes-gate and review-pass-12 todos; full 3-way sync (session DB ↔ todo-list.md ↔ detail files)

---

## Overview

This checkpoint covers two main bodies of work in this session:

1. **Pass 10 closure and C20 upgrade** (committed `75b3707` earlier this session) — all 38 Pass 10 findings resolved; C20 upgraded to TDK CGA9N1X7R1V476M230KC 35V; library imported.

2. **Todo dependency restructuring** — six dependency changes, one circular dep removed, two new todos added, and a full 3-way sync across session DB, `todo-list.md`, and detail files.

---

## Work Done

### Pass 10 (committed 75b3707)
- All 38 findings marked ✅ RESOLVED in `.copilot/review-report.md`
- C20: `CGA9N3X7R1E476M230KB` (25V) → `CGA9N1X7R1V476M230KC` (35V AEC-Q200)
  - DigiKey: `445-CGA9N1X7R1V476M230KCCT-ND` | Mouser: `810-CGA9N1X7R1V476M2` | JLCPCB: `C3873016`
- Library import: all 4 formats + footprint `CAPC5750X280N.kicad_mod` + 3D models
- Temp directory: all 8 zips moved to `.recycle-bin/library-temp-20260517/`
- 23 files changed; 233 insertions; 88 deletions

### Todo dependency changes

| Change | Type |
|---|---|
| `bom-pre-prototype-check` ← `consolidate-design-spec-content` | Added |
| `bom-pre-production-check` ← `compliance-testing` | Added |
| `bom-pre-production-check` ← `emc-testing` | Added |
| `bom-pre-production-check` ← `environmental-testing` | Added |
| `bom-pre-production-check` ← `security-testing` | Added |
| `consolidate-design-spec-content` ← `interim-electronics-review-3` | **Removed** |
| `consolidate-design-spec-content` ← `review-clean-passes-gate` | Added |
| `system-config-variants-diagrams` ← `prototype-pcb-manufacturing` | Added |
| `interim-electronics-review-1` ← `consolidate-design-spec-content` | Restored (safe after circular dep resolved) |
| `interim-electronics-review-1` ← `consolidate-design-spec-content` (old) | **Removed** (circular dep fix) then **re-added** |

**Circular dep resolved:** `gate-1 → consolidation → gate-3 → gate-2 → gate-1` broken by replacing the `consolidation → interim-electronics-review-3` dep with `consolidation → review-clean-passes-gate`.

### New todos

**`review-clean-passes-gate`** (pending)
- Aggregates all `review-pass-x` as deps (currently 7–12)
- Manually closed when 2 consecutive clean passes are confirmed
- Rule: whenever a new `review-pass-x` is created, add it as a dep here AND in the gate detail file
- Gates: `consolidate-design-spec-content`

**`review-pass-12`** (pending, blocked by `review-pass-11`)
- Added because pass 10 had findings; two clean passes (11 + 12) needed to close the gate
- If pass 12 also has findings, add pass 13 with the same pattern

### 3-way sync

- Session SQL DB: fully seeded — 113 todos (34 pending, 72 done, 7 blocked)
- `todo-list.md`: summary table, SQL todos block, SQL deps block — all updated
- Detail files created: `todos/review-clean-passes-gate.md`, `todos/review-pass-12.md`

## Technical Details

### Dependency chain for consolidation gate

```
enc-connector-review-pre-pcb ─┐
                               ├─▶ consolidate-design-spec-content ─▶ interim-electronics-review-1
review-clean-passes-gate    ──┘         ▲
   ├─▶ review-pass-7 (done)             │ (gate 1 deps on consolidation)
   ├─▶ review-pass-8 (done)
   ├─▶ review-pass-9 (done)
   ├─▶ review-pass-10 (done)
   ├─▶ review-pass-11 (pending ← download-missing-3d-models)
   └─▶ review-pass-12 (pending ← review-pass-11)
```

### Ready todos (0 unmet deps, non-blocked)
- `download-missing-3d-models`
- `extension-mechanical-usage`

### C20 technical detail
- TDK voltage codes: `1E`=25V, `1V`=35V; digit change `3→1` also changes product line
- 2.5× derating on 12V rail requires ≥30V rating; 35V satisfies this
- AEC-Q200 automotive grade retained

| `.copilot/checkpoints/index.md` | Entry 162 added |
| `design/Electronics/Controller/Design_Spec.md` | C20 → 35V (committed) |
| `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md` | C20 row updated (committed) |
| `src/Electronics/Library/SamacSys_Parts.*` | CGA9N1X7R1V476M230KC added (committed) |

## Next Steps

1. **`download-missing-3d-models`** — READY. Drop SamacSys zips for the 20 part-specific footprints into `src\Electronics\Library\temp\`. The 13 generic IPC footprints need KiCAD standard library `(model ...)` refs added.
   - See `.copilot/todos/download-missing-3d-models.md` for the full list and import instructions
2. **`extension-mechanical-usage`** — READY. No blocking deps.
3. **`review-pass-11`** — Blocked by `download-missing-3d-models`. Run once 3D models are complete.
4. **`review-pass-12`** — Blocked by `review-pass-11`. Run after pass 11.
5. Once both passes are clean → manually close `review-clean-passes-gate` → unblocks `consolidate-design-spec-content`.
