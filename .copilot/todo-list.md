# Enigma-NG Project Todo List

> **Canonical deferred-work and open-action reference.** Updated as work progresses.
> See also `.copilot/plan.md` for current workstream status and `.copilot/agent-directives.md` for operational rules.
>
> **Design Log Open Questions** are tracked separately in `design/Design_Log.md` under `## Open Questions`.
> Do not duplicate them here — that file is the authoritative source for formally raised design questions.
>
> **SQL tracking:** At the start of each session, populate the local SQLite `todos` and `todo_deps` tables
> from the SQL Reconstruction Reference section at the bottom of this file. That section is the authoritative
> dependency source; the in-session SQL is a convenience tracker only and does not persist across sessions.

## Open Workstreams (Plan-Level)

Long-running workstreams; tracked in `.copilot/plan.md` Current Open Workstreams table.

| ID | Description | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `extension-mechanical-usage` | Detailed switch/linkage geometry for Extension boundary carry is still needed; architectural answer (shared AM) is locked but physical linkage spec is not | pending | `plan.md` |
| `coupon-testing-review` | Add and review board-level coupons and PAS-oriented test coverage so production boards do not retain test-only hardware. Depends on: `extension-mechanical-usage` (connector changes likely) | pending | `plan.md` |
| `battery-connector-final-review` | Re-confirm Glenair `807-216-00ZNU6-6DY` contact assignment, `BATT_PRES_N` position, reserved-contact behaviour, cable selection, and interposer fit; check ODU AMC NP lead before closing | **🔒 blocked** — awaiting external supplier response | `plan.md` |
| ~~`general-pin-mapping-schematic-capture`~~ | ✅ **COMPLETE** — Footprints now available in KiCAD library; schematic capture can begin | done | `plan.md` |
| `rerun-deep-reviews` | Final pre-V1 cross-discipline deep-review cycle — run only once electrical, mechanical, and software work are complete and each board has a full KiCAD project with exported production Gerbers | pending | `plan.md` |

## Electronics Deferrals

| ID | Description | Status | Ref | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ctlh1-deferred` | Controller CTL-H1 finding: explicitly deferred by user during Pass 2 review cycle | ✅ DONE | — | Resolved checkpoint 076: R1/R2 stale placeholders removed; R3–R6 renumbered R1–R4 |
| `rotor-power-analysis-ministack` | Recalculate Rotor `Board_Layout.md §7` power analysis for mini-stack architecture. Currently assumes a single daisy-chain of 30 rotors (worst-case J2 input 1.65 A at Rotor 1). Architecture uses mini-stacks of max 5 rotors with an Extension Board re-introducing clean 3V3_ENIG at each mini-stack start — worst case is now 5 × 55 mA = 275 mA. Update: worked example, inline table (Rotor 1/15/30 rows), trace width table §7.1, and §7.2 notes. Also verify Extension Board power re-injection connector sizing. | ✅ DONE | DEC-053 | Checkpoint 098: power analysis rewritten for mini-stack; Extension connector under-spec discovered and resolved in checkpoint 099 (BHR-20-VUA → 2BHR-30-VUA) |
| `rotor-esd-tvs` | ✅ **DONE.** PRTR5V0U10AZ placeholder superseded; TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1 selected (reused from PM/CTL — no new part). U5–U12 fully defined in Design_Spec.md §6 and Board_Layout.md. All supplier PNs in Consolidated BOM. | ✅ DONE | — | Resolved prior session; confirmed 2026-05-03 |
| `rotor-variant-refdes-schematic` | ✅ **DONE.** Rotor variant A/B suffix convention agreed and implemented: U3→U3A, U4→U3B; all associated bypass caps (C16A/C17A/C16B/C17B) and resonant-tank components (C22A–C25A/C22B–C25B, L5A–L8A/L5B–L8B) renamed throughout Design_Spec.md, Board_Layout.md, Rotor_26_Char_Design.md, Rotor_64_Char_Design.md, and Consolidated_BOM.md. DEC-052 logged. KiCAD schematic will use U3A/U3B as unique RefDes with N26/N64 project variants selecting DNP flags. | ✅ DONE | DEC-052 | This session (2026-05-01); deferred until schematic capture |
| `display-addon-board` | 🚫 **DEFERRED TO V2.0.** Display add-on board design: J9 (Amphenol F52Q) on Controller is the only fixed connector; display power, touch wiring, and auxiliary harness remain deferred with the add-on board definition | blocked | DEC-033 | `design/Electronics/Controller/Design_Spec.md §8` |
| `cpld-production-replacement` | 🚫 **DEFERRED TO V2.0.** Review replacement CPLD for production stage (current MAX II EPM570 is a prototype-grade selection); update Certification Evidence §7.1 when confirmed | blocked | OA-04 | `design/Standards/Certification_Evidence.md` |
| `connector-thermal-verification` | **✅ DONE.** Thermal / current-capacity verification of active PM and Stator dock connectors (TE `1-1674231-1` / `1123684-7` and Molex `2195630015` / `2195620015`); full derating analysis documented in Certification Evidence §5.1. Temperature exception noted for TE connector (−20°C continuous vs DEFSTAN −40°C target); thermal shock test to −40°C cited as supporting evidence. Formal TE confirmation recommended before DEFSTAN submission. | done | OA-05 | `design/Standards/Certification_Evidence.md §5.1` |
| `full-pn-review` | Full supplier PN review of all BOM entries before schematic capture — a prior session that reduced component package sizes appears to have corrupted supplier PNs on at least two components (ERJ-2RKF1001X, CL05B104KB5NNNC), substituting codes pointing to entirely different parts. A sweep of all DigiKey / Mouser / JLCPCB PNs against their MPNs is required before KiCAD work begins. Depends on: `connector-thermal-verification`, `extension-mechanical-usage`, `battery-connector-final-review`, `ctlh1-deferred`, `rotor-esd-tvs`, `coupon-testing-review` | pending | — | 2026-05-02 supplier PN audit |
| `footprint-requests-pending` | Footprints requested but not yet received; update BOM and library when each arrives: **BAT54** (Diotec SOT-23) — requested, **AC72ABD** (72°C SMD thermal cutoff) — requested, **BMC-Q2AY0600M** (TE 600Ω 0805 AEC-Q200 ferrite bead) — requested, **2BHR-30-VUA** (Adam Tech 30-pin 2×15 IDC box header, JLCPCB C17346400; used at STA:J10, REF:J4, EXT:J7/J8) — requested, **TPS75733KTTRG3** (Texas Instruments 3.3V LDO TO-263-5) — ⚠️ footprint ready, no 3D model yet — download on next session, **MCP121T-450E/LB** (Microchip 4.5V supervisor SC70-3) — ⚠️ footprint ready, no 3D model yet — download on next session. Add further pending requests here as they arise. Depends on: `full-pn-review` | pending | — | 2026-05-02 |

## Software Deferrals

Depends on: `rerun-deep-reviews` + `prototype-pcb-manufacturing` (both required before SW deferrals can be actioned).

| ID | Description | Status | Ref | Source |

| `cpld-timing-load` | CPLD Encoder Logic timing and electrical load characterisation (propagation delays, fanout, drive current): deferred until first prototype boards exist for measurement | pending | — | `design/Software/CPLD_Logic/Encoder_Logic.md §2` |

---

## Standards & Certification Actions

Items from `design/Standards/Certification_Evidence.md §8`. All depend on `prototype-system-complete`.

| `da-03` | DA-03 | Full consistency documentation pass: legacy Link-Alpha / Link-Beta references must remain historical-only after DEC-038; verify any new docs added use TE PM dock / Molex Stator dock naming | Ongoing | open |
| `da-04` | DA-04 | Update Consolidated BOM with all locked Power Module components *(may be superseded by the 2026-05 BOM restructure — verify against current `Consolidated_BOM.md` before actioning)* | Post-eFuse lock | review needed |
