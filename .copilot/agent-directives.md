# Agent Directives — Enigma-NG

This file is the canonical list of standing rules and directives that govern how GitHub Copilot
(and any other AI agent) must behave when working on this repository. These rules take precedence
over any general defaults and must be loaded and followed in every session.

Read this file at session start alongside `.copilot/plan.md` and `.copilot/handoff.md`.

---

## PRIMARY DIRECTIVE — Part Number Protection

**NEVER modify any component MPN or supplier part number (Mouser SKU, DigiKey PN, JLCPCB C-number,
or any Alternative Supplier code) without explicit user confirmation.**

Every approved code in the design files and BOM is intentional and has been verified by the user.
Mouser in particular uses non-obvious abbreviations (e.g. dropping leading letters from TI MPNs).
These are correct. Do not "fix" them.

---

## SECONDARY DIRECTIVE - Git Commits

**NEVER perform a git commit without explicit user confirmation.**

All changes made to any files in the repository must be reviewed and acceptaed by the user before
they can be commited into the repository.
Possible user confirmation promts include:

- "Let's lock this in"
- "Save state"

When using these prompts, you should create a new checkpoint following the "Repo-Local State Rules" before performing the commit.

---

## Component Data Lookup Order

When researching any component, always use sources in this order:

1. **Reviewed markdown datasheet** — `design/Datasheets/<part>-datasheet.md`
2. **Local PDF datasheet** — `design/Datasheets/<part>-datasheet.pdf`
3. **Ask the user directly** — only if local sources are missing or insufficient

Do **not** perform web searches for component or supplier data. You will be rate-limited or blocked
and it wastes context budget. The user will provide any information that is not locally available.

---

## Version Metadata

Do **not** update any document `Version` field unless the user explicitly requests it. Do not infer
version bumps from the scope or significance of changes. The current baseline for all active docs
is `v.0.1.0`.

---

## Design Document Content Rules

- Design specs contain **current design only**. Do not preserve historical details in spec files.
- History belongs in `.copilot/checkpoints/` and `design/Design_Log.md`.
- Never change a component MPN without a corresponding local datasheet review in `design/Datasheets/`.
- Do not raise package-family or footprint-size differences as blocking issues until the user
  explicitly says schematic capture and layout have started. They are irrelevant at the pre-layout stage.
- Connector and mechanical-drawing datasheet markdowns can remain lightweight; fuller detail can
  wait until the initial KiCAD library generation or mechanical modeling phases.

---

## BOM Authority Rules

- Individual board `Design_Spec.md` files are the **authoritative source** for all component data.
- `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md` is a **derived document** — always rebuilt from board
  specs via `design/Electronics/all_boards_bom.json`. Never edit the consolidated BOM as a primary
  source and then work backwards.
- Supplier PN conventions confirmed by the user:
  - `TPD4E05U06QDQARQ1` → Mouser `595-PD4E05U06QDQARQ1` (drops leading `T`)
  - `LMQ61460AFSQRJRRQ1` → Mouser `595-Q61460AFSQRJRRQ1` (drops leading `LM`)
  - These are correct. Do not alter them.

---

## Repo-Local State Rules

- `.copilot/` is tracked in git and must stay in sync with meaningful design-state changes.
- At session start, read `.copilot/plan.md`, `.copilot/handoff.md`, and the latest relevant
  checkpoint(s) in `.copilot/checkpoints/`.
- A checkpoint is not complete until all of these are updated and consistent:
  - the new checkpoint file in `.copilot/checkpoints/`
  - `.copilot/checkpoints/index.md`
  - `.copilot/plan.md`
  - `.copilot/handoff.md`
- Sanitize all `.copilot/` content for version control: use repo-relative paths or
  `%USERPROFILE%` placeholders instead of machine-specific absolute paths. Do not persist raw
  usernames or session IDs.
- Repo-local helper scripts that should persist across sessions belong in `.copilot/agent-scripts/`.
  `design/Datasheets/_generated_markdown_inventory.json` is the full datasheet index — treat it as
  such, not as a partial single-run artifact.

## Deep-Dive Review Cycle

### When to run

Run the deep-dive review cycle when:

- The user explicitly requests it with **"Let's run a review cycle"**, or
- A new major design phase or design todo item is about to be marked complete.

### Review report file

At the start of each review cycle, create `.copilot/review-report.md`. This file is the running
audit log for the entire cycle. It is append-only — each pass adds a new entry; nothing is deleted.
When the cycle is complete and all items are resolved, the file may be deleted.

### Scope of review

Each cycle comprises two complementary review types:

> **IMPORTANT — Global Routing Rules first:** Before reviewing any board's `Design_Spec.md` or
> `Board_Layout.md`, every review agent **must** first read
> `design/Standards/Global_Routing_Spec.md`. Board-level specs and layouts only document
> **exceptions** to global rules, not restatements of them. A board that omits a value covered
> by a global rule is correct, not incomplete. Only raise a finding if a board explicitly claims
> to be exempt from a rule (and the exemption is missing or wrong), or if a board's inline value
> **contradicts** the global rule.

1. **Stand-alone board reviews** — each board's `Design_Spec.md` and `Board_Layout.md` are reviewed
   in isolation for internal consistency, completeness, FR/DR coverage, BOM accuracy, and correct
   component values.
2. **Integration review** — all boards are reviewed together to verify:
   - All inter-board connector pin-maps are consistent on both sides
   - Signal names and directions are agreed end-to-end
   - Rail names and voltages match across connector interfaces
   - `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md` is complete, accurate, and consistent with all
     board-level BOMs

### Agent execution model

- Launch all planned review agents in parallel batches of **maximum 4 agents at a time**.
- Each agent is given a specific review scope (e.g. one board, or one cross-board interface pair).
- All planned review batches must complete before any fixes are applied. Running the fix agent
  mid-cycle would leave the design in a potentially misaligned state while findings from later
  batches are still outstanding.
- Once **all** review batches have completed, run a single **fix agent** that:
  - Attempts to resolve all findings that are **simple, mechanical fixes** based on confirmed design
    details already in the specs (e.g. correcting a cross-reference, filling in a known value,
    fixing a lint error, aligning a BOM row with the board spec).
  - Does **not** fix anything that requires user input, involves a design decision not yet taken,
    or is not definitively resolved in the existing design documentation.
  - Flags all unfixed items clearly so the user can provide decisions.
- After the fix agent completes, run the full set of review batches again as a new pass.
- Repeat (all review batches → single fix agent) until **two consecutive complete review runs
  produce zero findings** at any severity level (HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW), except for items
  explicitly flagged as requiring user input.
- **The SECONDARY DIRECTIVE applies throughout the entire review cycle.** No git commit may be
  made at any point during a review cycle without explicit user confirmation. All changes
  accumulated during the cycle — including all fix-agent edits — must be presented to the user
  for approval before anything is committed.

### Pass result format

Each review pass entry in `review-report.md` must end with one of:

- `#### Pass N result: clean` — zero findings at any severity
- `#### Pass N result: N findings` — with a categorised table of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW items and
  which were fixed, which are deferred to user, and which carry over to the next pass

---

## Review Suppression

The following items are intentionally suppressed from automated review cycles. Do not raise them
as findings until the referenced pre-condition is complete.

- **PM-H5 — battery connector suitability review:** The Molex 43650-0519 versus Glenair/ODU
  military replacement review is ongoing; supplier responses are still pending. Do not flag this
  as an issue until the connector review is complete and a decision is recorded in the Design Log.
  See `design/Electronics/Power_Module/Millitary_Battery_Connection_Option.md` for background.

- **MOQ — Minimum Order Quantity:** MOQ values are informational only. Do not raise minimum order
  quantity as a review finding at any severity level. MOQ constraints are addressed at procurement
  time, not design time.

- **ROT-MOQ — Rotor R6/R7 pull-up resistors:** KOA Speer SG73S1ERTTP4701F 4.7kΩ carries Mouser
  MOQ 10,000 and JLCPCB MOQ 49. Accepted for the current batch-build plan. Do not raise as a
  BOM-MOQ finding.
