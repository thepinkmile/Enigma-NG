# Enigma-NG Handoff

This file is the generic repo-local handoff note for session-to-session context that is useful to
keep near the design docs but is **not** itself a source of design truth.

## Canonical design sources

Use the active `design/` documents as the authoritative record:

- `design/Design_Log.md`
- `design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md`
- board-level `design/Electronics/*/Design_Spec.md`
- board-level `design/Electronics/*/Board_Layout.md`
- relevant mechanical and software `Design_Spec.md` files
- `design/Datasheets/` for preserved vendor and project-side reference material

## 2026-04-26 session result

The latest repository state now includes the Encoder CPLD consolidation and logic-spec capture,
the battery-connector candidate note, and the new shared Actuation Module architecture for
Controller + Extension actuation.

Main outcomes:

- stale `probe` / `diagnostic` wording was removed from active design specs and board layouts
- board-layout headings were normalized so section numbering is file-local and `§` stays reserved
  for cross-document references
- the Reflector simplified layout was corrected to remove the duplicate Data Plate label
- Controller / Stator / Settings wording was cleaned up so I2C ownership, pass-through behavior,
  and servo ownership live in the correct documents
- the Stator Settings-board connector refdes was normalized from `J_CFG` to `J13`
- `.github/workflows/wiki-sync.yml` was updated to exclude `design/Datasheets`
- active component refdes were normalized to numeric refs across the design docs and consolidated
  BOM; this was committed as `7829f8a` (`Normalize design document refdes`)
- all markdown document metadata `Version` headers were reset to `v.0.1.0` by explicit user
  direction because the project is still in design phase
- local datasheet PDFs under `design/Datasheets/` now have generated markdown companions, those
  markdown datasheets were reviewed in category batches, and design-doc references were migrated
  from `.pdf` links to the corresponding `.md` datasheets
- Encoder Modules now use the common `EPM570T100I5N` part, external per-line debounce RC networks
  were retired from the active design, and role is selected by programming rather than by
  role-specific PCB population
- a new logic-spec document now exists at `design/Software/CPLD_Logic/Encoder_Logic.md` covering
  sampled 64-bit debounce, 64-to-6 encode, and 6-to-64 decode requirements for later VHDL work
- `design/Design_Log.md` now records this as **DEC-041**, which supersedes active Encoder-board
  assumptions around `EPM240T100I5N` and external RC debounce
- the active Encoder baseline now also explicitly records:
  - MAX II **weak pull-up** as the intended input-bias baseline for encode-role pins
  - internal/UFM oscillator use as the preferred debounce timebase
  - 64-character keyboard mapping as the primary `KBD_ENC` definition, with 26-character and custom
    educational keyboard mappings acknowledged as variant/follow-on work
  - generic `ENCODER MODULE` board-identification silkscreen only; role-specific silkscreen labels
    are no longer required
- the active HID connector contract now also records:
  - generic Encoder connector **pin 8 = `ENC_ACTIVE_N`**
  - `KBD_ENC` drives `ENC_ACTIVE_N` LOW only while a debounced keypress is active
  - the Stator source-select path switches both `ENC_DATA[5:0]` and the activity sideband so the
    physical keyboard and `CM5_KEY_DATA[5:0]` / `CM5_KEY_ACTIVE_N` stay aligned
  - `LBD_DEC` uses `ENC_ACTIVE_N` to blank all outputs when the selected keyboard source is idle
  - `design/Design_Log.md` records this connector and HID-blanking update as **DEC-042**
- the Power Module battery-connector review now has a dedicated candidate-note document,
  `design/Electronics/Power_Module/Millitary_Battery_Connection_Option.md`, which captures:
  - Glenair candidate `807-216-00ZNU6-6DY`
  - ODU AMC NP as an alternate military circular-connector lead pending sales-team feedback
  - a newly noted ODU advantage: panel-mount connector plus wiring-harness availability may avoid a
    custom PM interposer and may also simplify the prototype battery-pack / adapter build
  - Heilind-only sourcing with JLCPCB **consignment-only** assembly expectation
  - the provisional 6-pin vs 5-signal mapping caution
  - confirmed `Y` keying as the standard battery keying intended to prevent mating with data-only
    ports on standard in-service devices such as STAR-PAN and STAR-PAN NG
  - the preferred PM-side **interposer / daughterboard** integration approach
  - a separate prototype-only adapter board direction using the same female receptacle
  - a linked combined markdown datasheet extraction at `design/Datasheets/Glenair-807-216-datasheet.md`
    generated from the Glenair drawing PDF and the 807 NW catalogue PDF
  - closure of the battery-connector review workstream at the candidate-document stage, with the
  remaining connector specifics to be rechecked during the final deep-dive and manual review
  before the design is considered a complete Version 1 release
- the old direct Controller-local servo model has now been retired from the active docs in favour
  of a shared **Actuation Module (AM)** service board:
  - one AM is hosted on the Controller for the main depression-bar actuation path
  - each Extension hosts one AM to regenerate group-boundary carry into the next 5-rotor group
  - the host/AM contract is intentionally minimal: grouped `5V_MAIN`, `3V3_ENIG`, `GND`, and one
    active-low `ACTUATE_REQUEST`
  - the AM owns local servo homing, one-shot request capture, servo PWM generation, and local
    `PWR` / `HOMED` / `ACT` LEDs
- the AM now reserves separate local **J5 SWD** and **J6 UART/bootloader** service headers plus local
  **SW1 NRST** and **SW2 BOOT0** tactile buttons so the selected MCU can be programmed before first use
  with either path
- the AM board-layout note now uses separate TOP / BOTTOM views to make the fitted-side versus
  manual-fit-side intent explicit
- the AM now documents a reduced daughterboard decoupling scheme rather than a full 5x bulk-entry bank:
  C2-C3 = local STM32 100nF decouplers, C4 = 4.7uF on `3V3_ENIG`, C5 = 10uF on `5V_MAIN` near the
  servo power path; this is derived from the JDB daughterboard precedent but strengthened for the servo load
- BOM audit pass: active board design-spec BOMs currently show no open `TBD` / empty-supplier placeholder
  rows apart from the intentional CM5 distributor-only entry, and the consolidated AM section now carries
  explicit per-board and Rev A total counts for the current two-module design
- the additive senior-electronics deep-review loop for BOM/support-part completeness and connector
  consistency is now complete for the current design-doc set:
  - `.copilot/review-report.md` contains the full pass-by-pass audit through Pass 17
  - Pass 16 and Pass 17 both completed **clean** by the agreed review definition
  - the resulting design/BOM fixes remain intentionally uncommitted in the working tree
  - only the previously known deferred schematic-capture and owner-selected selections remain open
  - this does **not** close the repo-local `rerun-deep-reviews` workstream; that remains the final
    pre-V1 cross-discipline review gate after electrical, mechanical, and software work are complete and
    each board has a full KiCAD project with exported production Gerbers

## 2026-04-29 second deep-review cycle resolved (checkpoint 076)

All outstanding findings from the second electronics deep-review cycle resolved and committed.

Key changes:

- **DEC-046** written: 50V bypass/decoupling cap rating retained on all non-PM boards (no approved
  25V equivalents; cost delta negligible; PM input-side caps require 50V for derating margin)
- **Controller:** R1 (stale reset pull-up) and R2 (stale 100Ω differential termination) removed;
  R3–R6 renumbered to R1–R4 with no gaps
- **Rotor:** ESD section rewritten — phantom signals removed; U5–U12 array count corrected;
  `ENC_IN[5:0]` / `ENC_OUT[5:0]` now correctly listed
- **Power Module:** PM-H5 removed from spec body (not a design item; review suppression in handoff);
  ODU added as alternate military battery socket supplier alongside Glenair
- **Encoder:** "no longer a silkscreen requirement" → "is not a silkscreen requirement"
- **Stator:** retired servo requirements removed; FR-STA-13 typo fixed; requirements renumbered
- **Consolidated BOM:** 100Ω CTL termination row removed; 10kΩ CTL count 5→4 (total 22→21)

## 2025-07-05 BOM rebuild and part correction (checkpoint 077)

Consolidated BOM fully rebuilt from individual board Design_Spec.md files and CSD17578Q5A part
correction committed.

Key changes:

- **`design/Electronics/Consolidated_BOM.md`**: Completely rebuilt from `all_boards_bom.json`
  (sourced from all 10 board specs). 200 component rows, 115 unique MPNs. Both Section 1 (full
  table with all supplier PNs) and Section 2 (MPN quantity summary) present. Passes lint clean.
- **CSD17483F4T → CSD17578Q5A correction**: Q1/Q2/Q3 on Power Module were incorrectly specified
  as CSD17483F4T (1.5A FemtoFET PICOSTAR 3-pin). Correct part is CSD17578Q5A (30V/25A/5.9mΩ
  SON 5×6mm). DigiKey `296-48512-1-ND`, Mouser `595-CSD17578Q5A`, JLCPCB `C2871447`.
- **`design/Electronics/Power_Module/Design_Spec.md`**: Q1/Q2/Q3 row and design notes updated.
- **`design/Electronics/all_boards_bom.json`**: CSD17483F4T → CSD17578Q5A row corrected.
- **`design/Design_Log.md`**: DEC-047 written for CSD17578Q5A correction.
- Nexperia vs NXP: `74HC157PW-Q100,118` now correctly shows **Nexperia** in the consolidated BOM.
- LMQ61460AFSQRJRRQ1 Mouser PN `595-Q61460AFSQRJRRQ1` confirmed correct (Mouser drops "LM" prefix).

## Next return summary

When resuming, read `.copilot/checkpoints/077-bom-rebuilt-csd17578q5a-corrected.md` for current state.

Next checkpoint will be **079**.


## Standing Directives

All standing operational rules, the PRIMARY DIRECTIVE on part number protection, data-lookup order,
version-metadata policy, BOM authority rules, and review suppression notes are consolidated in
`.copilot/agent-directives.md`. Read that file at session start — it takes precedence over any
general defaults.

## Remaining follow-up work

These are still open design review items, but they are not yet committed design decisions:

1. Review how Extensions should be used mechanically, including whether interconnect choices for the
   Stator / Reflector / Extension chain should change.
2. Add and review board-level coupons and PAS-oriented test coverage.
3. During later schematic capture, treat the remaining exact package pin/pad assignment work as one
   combined pin-mapping task across the AM STM32, Stator mux U7, and the Encoder / Stator / Rotor CPLD
   parts, aligned with the planned KiCAD project and shared component-library setup; this same
   workstream also preserves the chosen external `J5` / `J6` pinouts, the local `SW1` / `SW2`
   tactile pair on `NRST` / `BOOT0`, and the agreed logical signal roles while locking the exact
   STM32 pad assignment and default `BOOT0` bias network behind them.
4. During the final deep-dive and manual review before declaring Version 1 complete, re-confirm the
   chosen military battery connector details, especially the remaining 6-pin contact assignment,
   `BATT_PRES_N` position, reserved/unused contact behaviour, cable selection, and interposer fit.
